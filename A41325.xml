            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>PEllarella,</hi> or <hi>Morphewe,</hi> is a kind of Pox, and is one of the fir≈øt <hi>Pre≈øagia</hi> of that di≈øea≈øe, and is a corrupt humour, and ≈øo drying, that in ≈øhort time it mortifieth the haire of the head and beard, and eye-browes, and cau≈øeth them to fall off. You ≈øhall under≈øtand that this di≈øea≈øe is ≈øuch a thing, that it cannot be helped by any meanes, except it be taken in time, before the haire be mortified. Neverthele≈ø≈øe I will ≈øhew a ≈øecret unto the World, to know when a man hath that di≈øea≈øe or no, and in what time he may help it that they ≈øhall not fall. The ≈øecret is this, Thou ≈øhalt under≈øtand, that the beginning of <hi>Pellarella,</hi> is one <hi>Carvoli</hi> or more that cometh upon the Yeard, the which ≈øeemeth to be of little importance, becau≈øe they are holpen with ea≈øe, but within ten, or fifteen daies after they are whole, there will come a certaine alteration in the throate, which will not ≈øuffer him to ≈øwallow his meat, which doth indure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eight or ten daies, and ≈øo goe away by it ≈øelfe without any medicine, and in that time the haire is mortified, and then within two or three moneths the haire will fall: ≈øo that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45531:25"/>
this is the cau≈øe why they cannot be help'd when they fall away, for the time was pa≈ø≈øed before, and the rootes mortified. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou wilt keep thy ≈øelf from running into ≈øuch a great danger, thou maie≈øt do it ea≈øily if thou take it in time: and the remedie is this. When you have had any of the≈øe <hi>Carvoli,</hi> and that after there cometh an alteration in the throate, then pre≈øently purge, and u≈øe a defen≈øive unction that the haire may not mortifie. You ≈øhall purge him nine dayes every morning with our <hi>Sirupo Magi≈øtrale,</hi> and fa≈øt thereon four houres. The do≈øe is from ‚Ñ• iii. to ‚Ñ• vi. that being done, you ≈øhall give him ‚Ñ•. <hi>di.</hi> of <hi>Electuario Angelica,</hi> according to the recept, and in the mean time annoint all his face and head with our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and doing thus, it is not po≈ø≈øible that the haire ≈øhould fall off. This is a ≈øecret, the which few men have known, and never written of any before this time, and is of ≈øo great importance, that it were nece≈ø≈øarie to be known for an univer≈øall health, that every man might keep him≈øelf from this di≈øea≈øe.</p>

There is another kind of Cough that troubleth much old folke, and that is of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhous humour. The third kind of Cough written of by us, is that which cometh to tho≈øe that have the Fever <hi>Hectick.</hi> Al≈øo there is another kind which is cau≈øed of the French Pox. And the≈øe are the foure kindes of Coughes that do commonly happen vnto men and women. The fir≈øt kind of Cough that happeneth unto man through cold, is ea≈øie to be helped, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it ≈øelf will help it without any other helpe: but if thou wilt helpe nature thou maie≈øt with ea≈øe, and that ≈øhall be with eating drie and apperatiue meates, and drinking good wine, and ≈øo the Cough will goe away quickly. But the Cough which cometh to old folk, is cau≈øed of a Catarrhous humour, which is nothing el≈øe but debilitie of nature, for lack of naturall heat, the which cau≈øeth the ≈øtomack that it cannot dige≈øt his meate in ≈øuch order as it ≈øhould, but ingendreth tho≈øe ≈øuperfluous humours, that cau≈øe the Cough. And this mu≈øt be helped with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45531:26"/>
keeping of diet; that is, to eat little meat, and to u≈øe thing that warm the ≈øtomack and help dige≈øtion, and this thou ≈øhalt doe in this order.

Tho≈øe that are hot and dry, mu≈øt have Medicines that cool the heat, and extingui≈øh the drine≈ø≈øe, and this thou ≈øhalt doe with Sirrup of <hi>Citarch,</hi> and purge often with <hi>Ca≈øsia,</hi> and u≈øe

cooling things, as <hi>Succorie, Melons, Lettice,</hi> and ≈øuch like. The other kinde which is hot and moi≈øt, you mu≈øt fir≈øt help the heat, and then dry the humiditie, which you ≈øhall doe with vomiting, and purging, and keeping diet, and eating of drying meats. The fir≈øt drying ≈øcab you ≈øhall annoint one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> which without help of any other thing, will cure it after they be purged, as is before ≈øaid.

                     <p>THe≈øe in <hi>Naples</hi> be called <hi>Moricole,</hi> and in <hi>Venice, Maroelle,</hi> and in <hi>Spain, Almorane;</hi> and are an alteration of blood in the Emorodiall veins, which many times come forth in the lower parts with great pain, and the≈øe are cau≈øed of putrified humours of the bodie, and corruption of the blood, which corruption many times cometh of the Pox, or ≈øuch like di≈øea≈øes. There are al≈øo divers kinds, but principally two: The one ≈øort is within the fundament, and cau≈øeth great pain when they go to ≈øtool: The other ≈øort cometh forth of the fundament, and are not ≈øo painfull as the other are. To cure them that are within the Fundament, you ≈øhall give the Patient eight or ten mornings our <hi>Syrupo Magi≈øtrale,</hi> and then let him take of our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram"> í</g>. ii. and u≈øe Gli≈øters wherein is put half an ounce of <hi>Aqua reale</hi> at a time, and ≈øo thou ≈øhalt help them. The be≈øt remedie for tho≈øe that come forth is to make inci≈øion, or to make a little hole in them, that the blood may come forth which is putrified, and ≈øo by evacuation thou ≈øhalt help them. Al≈øo thou ≈øhalt under≈øtand, that vomiting is nece≈ø≈øarie in the cure of them both, becau≈øe it openeth the veins. Al≈øo oil of Eggs, and oil of Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen≈øe, and oil of Lin≈øeed are very profitable to annoint them therewith to ea≈øe the pain.</p>

                     <p>THe Fever <hi>Quotidian</hi> or continuall Fever, or any other kind what≈øoever, do proceed onely of two principall cau≈øes, that is, of corruption and putrefaction, as you may perceive how that when the Fever is entred, the Patient is all corrupted, beginning at the ≈øtomack, the which is fir≈øt corrupted. For proof you may alwaies ≈øee that a≈ø≈øoon as a man is ≈øick, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45531:28"/>
he loo≈øeth his appetite and cannot eat; afterward it corrupteth the blood, for by experience, if you let them blood, it is alwaies found corrupted, and not as it is in a ≈øound bodie. It corrupteth al≈øo the ≈øen≈øes, ≈øo that the ≈øick is not ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ≈øenced, nor cannot ≈øleep, or re≈øt by any means whil≈øt he hath that accident. That it is cau≈øed al≈øo of Putrifaction you may ≈øee by them, that have the Fever. For alwaies when the Fever cometh, pre≈øently the ≈øtomack doth putrifie, and ≈øpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth filthy ≈øpittle: Al≈øo it doth putrifie the bodie, becau≈øe their Excrements that they void are putrified and ≈øtinking more then others, and their Urine putrified and alterated from his naturall cour≈øe. Then ≈øeeing the Fever is cau≈øed of corruption and putrifaction, there are four things nece≈ø≈øarie to be done in the cure thereof. The fir≈øt is, to evacuate the ≈øtomack: The ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to purge by urine: The third, to evacuate the bodie: And the fourth is, to purge by ≈øweat: Which four operations may be done one after another with great ea≈øe, and will re≈øtore the Patient to his health. But you ≈øhall under≈øtand, that all cannot be holp, for that God almightie hath made us to die, and when that time cometh, medicines will doe no good, but if that time be not yet come, by the help of God, with the≈øe Medicines he ≈øhall be re≈øtored to his former health. The fir≈øt thing, as I ≈øaid, is to take a vomit, which doth evacuate the ≈øtomack of choler and flegm, that doth much offend the bodie di≈øea≈øed: After that, evacuate the bodie with tho≈øe things that the Phy≈øician thinketh mo≈øt convenient for that purpo≈øe, for there be many purgations to di≈ø≈øolve the body, and to evacuate malign humours: After that, make him purge by urine. Fourthly, and la≈øt of all, give him medicines that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the pores, and that provoketh ≈øweat. And thus with the≈øe four operations, the mo≈øt part ≈øhall be holp of that infirmitie with great ea≈øe, and in ≈øhort time: And as I have ≈øaid, this is a mo≈øt true order that never faileth, except (as I ≈øaid before) when the Lord will call them. And as for the≈øe medicines, you ≈øhall find them written in this book ≈øeverally with their u≈øes and quantities.</p>

                     <p>IF thou wilt help the ≈øaid Fevers according to our order: when the Patient is greatly alterated therewith, thou ≈øhalt u≈øe five waies wherewith thou ≈øhalt ea≈øily help them, the which are the≈øe. The fir≈øt as I ≈øaid before is Vomit: the ≈øecond eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the body: the third evacuation by urine: the fourth to provoke ≈øweat: and the fifth by unction. Neverthele≈ø≈øe each of the≈øe alone is ≈øufficient to help the ≈øaid Fever: but yet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing them all five, there is no doubt but thou maie≈øt di≈ø≈øolve any evill ≈øort of maligne Fever, except as I ≈øaid before, God will call them out of this World: but to the purpo≈øe of the cure. Fir≈øt thou ≈øhalt ≈øet on five or ≈øix boxing gla≈ø≈øes, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and age of the infirmed: then the next morning give him one do≈øe of our <hi>Electuario angellica,</hi> with Sirrup of Sorrell, and water of Sorrell. Then the next morning following give him ≈øome Sirrup appropriate for that di≈øea≈øe, and put thereto ‚Ñ•. ii. of <hi>Sirrupo Magi≈øtrale,</hi> with <hi>Rhabarbe:</hi> that being ended, give him three or foure times Julep of Violets with Oyle of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> made <hi>per Campana,</hi> the do≈øe of the Julep is ‚Ñ• ii. and of the Oyle of <hi>Sulphur</hi> four or five graines mixed together, and this you ≈øhall take in ≈øtead of Sirrup betimes in the morning, and it will make them ≈øweat and purge by urine, which are mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary for the ≈øick: and in the mean ≈øea≈øon you ≈øhall annoint them every night with <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> which will make them re≈øt well, and take away all their paines throughout the body, and ≈øo by this meanes the Fever ≈øhall be perfectly taken away. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo take great heed that you take no more blood then is nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary, neither let them keep any ≈øtraight Diet, but let them keep a good regiment of Life. But when this Feaver doth come through ≈øome other cau≈øe, then it were nece≈ø≈øary to remove the principall cau≈øe, if thou wilt cure them: For if it be cau≈øed of a <hi>Catarre,</hi> of nece≈ø≈øitie you mu≈øt di≈ø≈øolve the <hi>Catarre</hi> fir≈øt; and then help the Fever. Al≈øo if the Fever be cau≈øed of a wound, it were nece≈ø≈øary fir≈øt to take away the pain of the

wound, and then the Fever will depart. And thus in every kind of Fever, it is mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary to know the originall from whence it is cau≈øed: And this is the true way to cure the≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, which I have proved infinite times.</p>

                     <p>THere are many kindes of Fevers, therefore I will mention of them that are mo≈øt known unto the world, and fir≈øt of the continuall Fever, that is of tho≈øe that are onely hot, and continue in one order both day and night, the which is caus'd of alteration and corruption of the humours in the body, which engender ≈øo much corruption in the ≈øtomack, and in the blood, that they cau≈øe that accident of Fever: And the very order to cure it is this. In the beginning of the alteration let him keep a good diet, and drink no wine: and that is done becau≈øe that corruption is apt to corrupt all that entereth into the body du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that alteration, and therefore meates of great ≈øub≈øtance or nouri≈øhment, are ≈øooner turned into greater putrifaction in the body: But when the third day of the Fever is pa≈øt, then take of our <hi>Aromatico</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram"> í</g>. ii. which will evacuate the ≈øtomack of that corruption: and that day that you take this <hi>Aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> drink as much crude water as you will: which is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the ≈øtomack ≈øhall remaine cleare wa≈øhed of that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being done, you ≈øhall give him three or four morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings our <hi>Soluble Sirrup,</hi> and give him good meates, and let him drink Wine, becau≈øe it cannot hurt in any wi≈øe, for it cannot putrife in the body: For the ≈øirrup doth evacuate every day the corruption: and when the blood is alterated of that putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it goeth to the veines, and ≈øo di≈øper≈øeth through the whole body. It would be good to ≈øet on boxing gla≈ø≈øes to take away blood, and al≈øo to u≈øe drying unctions, as our <hi>Bal≈øae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo artificato,</hi> and Oyle of Turpentine and Wax, and thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if the Patient be not called of God) thou ≈øhalt helpe him within ≈øhort ≈øpace.

                     <p>THis Fever is a vi≈øcous and putrified humour in the ≈øtomack and lunges, the which is cau≈øed of a debility and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of nature that cannot dige≈øt the offen≈øive humours. There are divers ≈øorts of this Fever, neverthele≈ø≈øe they are all evill to be holpt, and are counted uncurable. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, I will ≈øhew thee ≈øome excellent remedie very whol≈øom, that may plea≈øure them, although they are nigh their death. The fir≈øt medicine that ≈øhall do them good, is our <hi>Electuario angellica,</hi> of which you ≈øhall give halfe an ounce in the morning fa≈øting, for this pre≈øently joyneth unto the ≈øtomack, and draweth to it all the offen≈øive humours, and carrieth them forth by vomit and ≈øeege, and ≈øo leaveth the ≈øtomack ea≈øed and clean, that the Patient thinketh him≈øelf whole: But yet the ≈øtomack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth againe to fill with a great ≈øuffocation, that will not let the Patient take re≈øt, ≈øo that this medicine may well ea≈øe them, but not helpe them quite.

                     <p>MAny have thought that the Fever <hi>Hectick</hi> is altogether de≈øperate and uncurable, and that by no meanes it might be re≈øolved: But becau≈øe it is cau≈øed of divers and ≈øundry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, I ≈øay that many kindes may be helped and cured: For I find it may come of infinite cau≈øes, as afore≈øaid. There is one kind that cometh through the weakne≈ø≈øe of nature it ≈øelf, and that beginneth to de≈øtroy the Lunges, and that kind I find to be incurable, becau≈øe it is cau≈øed of the evill nature of the man, and not through any accident, and in that ca≈øe I beleeve it cannot be di≈ø≈øolved by any meanes. Al≈øo there are many other <hi>Hecticks</hi> cau≈øed of the French-Pox, of which I have ≈øeen and cured an infinite, and they are ea≈øie to cure: For curing the Pox, the Fever will be di≈ø≈øolved. There is another kind that dependeth of a ≈øalt humour, and ≈øome other of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarre, and of many other things: Therefore if thou wilt help the ≈øaid Fever, it were nece≈ø≈øary to know the true cau≈øe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it dependeth, the which in my judgement is hard to be known, if that the Patient him≈øelf do not tell it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is nece≈ø≈øary for the Phy≈øitian to examin them well, and to enquire whether they have had any kind or ≈øpice of the <hi>Mal France≈øe</hi> before, whereof the ≈øaid Fever might have his original: and ≈øo doing, he with his judgement may be re≈øolved of the nature of that infirmity: and if it chaunce that the ≈øaid Fever had his originall of the Pox, the Phi≈øician may re≈øolve it with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines appropriate for that di≈øea≈øe, with purging him ≈øtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and giving him <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> or <hi>Sal≈øa pariglia,</hi> and al≈øo perfume him with <hi>Olibanum Sinaber</hi> and <hi>Mirrha, ana:</hi> and ≈øo by the help of God, and meanes of the≈øe medicines thou ≈øhalt help them all, or at lea≈øt the mo≈øt part of that kind of Fever <hi>Hectick.</hi> But if the Phi≈øician find that kind of Fever to be cau≈øed of a Catarre, then u≈øe the medicines that help the Catarre, and ≈øo the Fever ≈øhall be whole. But when he

findeth it to be of the weakne≈ø≈øe of Nature, in that ca≈øe there is no help that is ≈øure.

                     <p>THe Fever <hi>Quartane</hi> is cau≈øed of a melancholie humour as afore≈øaid, with a continuall di≈øtillation of the head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcending to the ≈øtomack, and augmenting the evill di≈øpo≈øition of the body; and by rea≈øon of that di≈øtillation, provoketh much ≈øweat when the accident of the Fever cometh: And likewi≈øe that di≈øtillation cau≈øeth ≈øuch cold in the Marrow of the Reins and Back, and an infinite of other di≈øorders which trouble the bodie greatly. But to avoid all the≈øe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and to di≈ø≈øolve wholly that accident of the <hi>Quartane</hi> according to our order, becau≈øe I have helped more then any Phy≈øitian of our time. I will ≈øhew thee how with the≈øe Remedies following thou ≈øhalt help them, though not all, yet the greater part truly mo≈øt miraculou≈øly, and the Order to di≈ø≈øolve it is thus. You ≈øhall give the Patient a do≈øe of our <hi>Aromatico</hi> in the morning to eat, and drink thereon two or three ounces of good wine, and fa≈øt thereon ≈øix hours, and this Medicine is mo≈øt convenient the day of the fit, becau≈øe the infirmitie removeth great quantitie of humours, and the medicine evacuateth them; and thus giving it three times in the day of the fit, it will work a great operation. But if the Fever be in a per≈øon of melancholie complexion, then it is where it would be; for you may ≈øee that in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie per≈øon, the Fever hath more force, then in any other complexion, which proveth, that the Fever, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion are mo≈øt like: But in that ca≈øe you ≈øhall cure them in this Order: You ≈øhall give him ten or fifteen daies out
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45531:33"/>
                        <hi>Sirrup</hi> again≈øt the melancholie humour, which is written in this Book, which you ≈øhall take two hours before day hot, and then ≈øleep one ≈øleep thereon, and thus doe every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and every night annoint all the parts of the body with our <hi>Bal≈øamo artificiato,</hi> and he ≈øhall be holpen. But if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that this doth not cure him, let not to give him this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which mo≈øt ≈øurely (God willing) will help him, and that remedie is our <hi>Aqua Bal≈øami,</hi> of which he ≈øhall take every morning two Drachms fa≈øting, and ≈øo continue untill the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be gone quite: ≈øo that of force u≈øing all the afore≈øaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, the Fever mu≈øt needs depart. And the rea≈øon is this, that our <hi>Aromatico</hi> evacuateth the ≈øtomack of all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by vomit, and letteth the de≈øcen≈øion of the head, which cau≈øeth the accident. Our <hi>Syrrup</hi> evacuateth the melancholie humour, and di≈ø≈øolveth it by his proper qualitie. Our <hi>Bal≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> the which is ≈øubtile and penetravive drieth and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the place offended, in ≈øuch order, that it ca≈øteth forth all the matter that may offend Nature.

                     <p>SEeing the Gout (as I ≈øaid before) are gro≈ø≈øe humours undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øted coming of the afore≈øaid cau≈øe, it were mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if thou wilt cure them to do three operations. The fir≈øt of them is Phlebothomie, which mu≈øt be done under the tongue, cutting overthwart one of tho≈øe two veines: For that Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomie evacuateth the ≈øtomocall humours that are cau≈øe of that corruption. The ≈øecond operation that is to be done, is to a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øubtiliate the gro≈øs and rotten humours, and to evacuate them quite. The third operation that is to be done, is to pre≈øerve nature in good temperature, and to help the dige≈øtion, and thus doing, the ≈øaid infirmity ≈øhall be extincted. If therefore thou wilt helpe the Gout, and after they are helped, keep the Patient in good temperature and pro≈øperity of life, it were nece≈ø≈øary to do the≈øe three operations. After the fir≈øt is done, as I have ≈øaid, it were needfull to come to the ≈øecond, which is to a≈ø≈øubtiliate the gro≈øs humours, which will be done with four remedies. The fir≈øt of them is our <hi>Quinta e≈ø≈øentia ≈øolutiva,</hi> which ≈øubtiliateth the humours, and evacuateth them downwards. The ≈øecond reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is our <hi>Electuario angelica,</hi> which evacuateth the humours hanging in all parts, and leaveth nature ≈øo ea≈øed, that it may well prevaile. The third remedie is a Fomentation, which drieth up the humidity of the head and ≈øtomack, and by meanes of that operation the di≈øea≈øe ≈øhall remaine extincted. The fourth and la≈øt remedie is our <hi>Bal≈øamo</hi> again≈øt the paines, with which you ≈øhall annoint upon the place grieved, for it mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth the paines greatly.

                     <p>THe <hi>Sciatica</hi> is ≈øo called, becau≈øe it is upon the bone which is called <hi>Scio,</hi> and of that it taketh the name <hi>Sciatica,</hi> the which is cau≈øed of an evill qualitie in the Stomack and Liver, the which you may ≈øee by the cure; for if ye cure the Stomack, and help the Liver, the <hi>Sciatica</hi> will cea≈øe, and by this means thou maye≈øt ≈øee whether I ≈øay the truth or no. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that the <hi>Sciatica</hi> is cau≈øed as is ≈øaid before, ye ≈øhall under≈øtand that it is ≈øo cau≈øed, by rea≈øon that the ≈øtomack can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well dige≈øt that which it ≈øhould, and ≈øo it cau≈øeth crude and undige≈øted humours, of the which Nature would be di≈øcharged, he ca≈øteth them forth of the ≈øtomack, and having no other way to come forth of the Stomack but by the ordinary waies, they doe pa≈ø≈øe, and of force they mu≈øt pa≈ø≈øe by tho≈øe powers that pa≈ø≈øe by the Liver, and ≈øo the Liver which is able both to re≈øolve the good and the evill qualitie, remaineth ≈øtill infected of that indi≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not being able to dige≈øt them according unto the order of Nature, they ingro≈øs and become maligne, and then Nature the which with all indu≈øtrie would di≈øcharge him≈øelf of that burthen, ≈øending them to the higher parts, ≈øendeth them downwards, and when they come unto <hi>Scio,</hi> where they mu≈øt pa≈ø≈øe with difficultie by certain ≈ømall mu≈øcles, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro≈ø≈øe in that place, and cau≈øe inflamation and pain, the

which Inflamation or ≈øwelling, after the bodie is well purged, is re≈øolved with <hi>Ve≈øicatores Vento≈øos,</hi> and attractive Cerots and ≈øuch like things. Al≈øo attractive Gli≈øters are mo≈øt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome, becau≈øe they di≈øcharge the humour in the lower parts, and comfort the <hi>Sciatica.</hi> Neverthele≈ø≈øe, ye ≈øhall under≈øtand that there are certain and true appropriate Medicines to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolve it with brevity, the which are the≈øe that follow. Fir≈øt, when the Patient is in mo≈øt extream pain, let him blood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tongue, the which is ≈øuch a ≈øingular remedie, that it cau≈øeth the world to wonder thereat: after that purge him with our <hi>Soluble Sirrup,</hi> ≈øix or ≈øeven daies, that being done, take away the water which cau≈øeth the pain, then comfort the Patient with the Oil that is ≈øeparated from the flower of flowers, and di≈øtilled in a Retort, then all this being done, the Patient ≈øhall remain helped to thy great honour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that will cure the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> it were nece≈ø≈øary that hee con≈øider well of the nature and qualitie of the infirmitie, and when they are ≈øatisfied to be the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> in that ca≈øe cure them according to this our Order, the which by the grace of God, and vertue of the≈øe Medicines, they ≈øhall remain helped of that indi≈øpo≈øition, for this is a great Secret.</p>

Neverthele≈ø≈øe, I will ≈øhew thee the Secret to cure it generally, and the order is thus.

                     <p>THe pain in the Head is a di≈øea≈øe of the brains, which is cau≈øed of putrified humours in the ≈øtomack, the which is like unto a pot that boileth, cau≈øing the vapours to a≈øcend, which if they be evill, the fume is evill to the ta≈øte and ≈ømell; but if there boil any good thing therein, the fumes are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant both to the ≈ømell and ta≈øte. And ≈øo likewi≈øe our ≈øtomack being filled with good juyce, filleth the brain with good fumes; but being filled with evill corrupt humours, it hurteth the brain, and cau≈øeth pains of the head. The like pains of the head may come of alteration of the blood, and to helpe that accident, you mu≈øt fir≈øt remove the cau≈øe principall, which is done with purging, and evacuating of the ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack of tho≈øe putrified humours; which thou ≈øhalt do with our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> giving it to the Patient two or thre times, every five daies once.

                     <p>THe Infirmities of the Eies cometh of divers and ≈øundry cau≈øes, of the which I will make mention, e≈øpecially of tho≈øe that are of mo≈øt importance, and mo≈øt dangerous to hurt the ≈øight. There is one that is called in Italian <hi>Razoni,</hi> and that is cau≈øed of the heat of the blood, and his effects are certain ≈ømall wheals that run round about the eye-lids, and this Infirmitie is of ≈ømall importance, for onely with lina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45531:38"/>
of <hi>Tutia</hi> they may be healed, annointing them three or four times. There is another kind of infirmitie in the eyes that cometh to many, and is cau≈øed of moi≈øture and heat in the head, and that is a redne≈øs with watering and great burning: And although this be trouble≈øome, yet it is not dangerous to heal. For with purging the head and bodie, and with Boxing gla≈ø≈øes, and with certain Unctions appropriate they ≈øhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main whole. There is another kinde of infirmitie in the eie, and that is when the ball of the eie waxeth out of mea≈øure in greatne≈ø≈øe, and this is called <hi>Dilatatio pupillae,</hi> the which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to heal.

There is yet another ≈øort of infirmitie that cau≈øeth the eie to be full of pain, and cometh all thick and filthy, and blindeth it, and this indi≈øpo≈øition is cau≈øed of <hi>Morbo Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co;</hi> and although it ≈øeem foul and uncurable: Neverthele≈ø≈øe, it is ea≈øie to be cured if you help the principall cau≈øe, and fume the head with <hi>Cinabar, Myrrh,</hi> and <hi>Olibanum,</hi> they ≈øhall be quickly helped.

                     <p>THe pain of the teeth is an accidentall di≈øea≈øe, which cometh of divers and ≈øundry cau≈øes, of the which cau≈øes, I will ≈øhew the chiefe≈øt. It cometh ≈øometimes of a Rheum in the head, or of a Catarr, or of humiditie in the

                     <p>THe ≈øpitting of blood is an alteration of blood in the veins, which alteration is ≈øo much, that Nature provoketh it to the ≈øtomack, from whence it had his Originall, and doth not come of a vein broken as many have ≈øaid, as thou mai≈øt well ≈øee the truth; for if the vein were broke, the blood would come forth at one time or in≈øtant without any tarrying, and they would die quickly, the which cometh not by ≈øpitting of blood, for they ≈øpit none untill the alteration cometh: and this is cau≈øed of a kind of Fever that cometh inwardly, that ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth that alteration, and when his fit cometh, the blood doth alter, and the veins ≈øwell, and the blood doth come forth at the proper mouthes of the veins, and ≈øo they ≈øpit it forth; and when they ≈øpit blood, it is the beginning of the Fever <hi>Hectick.</hi> the which when it is confirmed, is uncurable and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: But if thou wilt take it at the beginning when they ≈øpit blood, it may be helped with ea≈øe, and that thou ≈øhalt doe with giving them three or four times of our <hi>Petra Philo≈øopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> twelve grains, with halfe an ounce of Sugar <hi>Ro≈øate,</hi> every third day once; that being done, let him take every morning Oil of <hi>Vitriol</hi> iiii. grains, with Julep of Violets ‚Ñ•. i. becau≈øe there is no better medicine in the world that di≈øpo≈øeth the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the blood, then our <hi>Petra Philo≈øophale,</hi> and the oil of <hi>Vitrial</hi> mittigateth the heat and extingui≈øheth the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

So that the Spleen is like a ≈øpunge, and very apt to receive that humiditie, that Nature cannot di≈ø≈øolve otherwi≈øe, and ≈øo by this rea≈øon it is mo≈øt apt to be ≈øick or di≈øea≈øed: therefore if thou wilt cure it, fir≈øt cure the di≈øea≈øe which cau≈øeth that alteration, for that being once helped, Nature of it ≈øelf will help the Spleen without any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and therefore ≈øtrive not to help the Spleen with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Medicines, for it is vain; but look what kinde of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe the Patient is troubled with, and cure that, and then the Spleen will heal well enough. And this is the true way to cure the Spleen.</p>

                     <p>THe cau≈øes of the retention of Urine are many, among the which, there are three principally above the re≈øt, and are ≈øo manife≈øt, that every one may under≈øtand them: and are the≈øe.

Neverthele≈ø≈øe, I will treat of ≈øome of the principall, and of mo≈øt importance; and al≈øo will ≈øhew the true order to help them with ea≈øe and brevitie. The fir≈øt cau≈øe a≈ø≈øigned by me is the Stone in the Bladder, and this is in a manner uncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The ≈øecond cau≈øe is, the running of the Reins, the which is taken by companying with women corrupted with the Pox. The third cau≈øe is, the proper French Pox, the which is that kind that is called <hi>Gonorrea.</hi> The fourth kind is a certain corruption that is called <hi>Stranguria,</hi> the which moveth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to make water. The fifth cau≈øe is the Gravell: there are al≈øo other cau≈øes, as ≈øcorching in the Yeard, carno≈øitie, and ≈øuch like things, the which I will leave for troubling of the Reader. The fir≈øt cau≈øe which is the Stone, is helped by two remedies, the one is with cutting and taking it forth of the bladder, the other remedie is written in this book. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for that which is cau≈øed by the running of the Reins, ≈øhall be to take three mornings our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> becau≈øe it re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that heat, and extingui≈øheth the burning. The remedie for that which is cau≈øed of <hi>Gonorrea,</hi> is none other then to cure the principall di≈øea≈øe, and to annoint them with our <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nguento magno,</hi> and perfume them, and ≈øo they ≈øhall remain whole. That which is cau≈ø≈øed of the Strangurie, is cured by great purging, and by taking oftentimes our <hi>Aromatico.</hi> That which is cau≈øed of the Gravell, is cured by taking often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our <hi>Electuario Angelica,</hi> and u≈øing to drinke Wine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtilled with Cherrie ≈øtones, and Medler ≈øtones. That which cometh through carno≈øitie, is cured with an Unguent made of oil of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol, Aqua reale,</hi> Oil of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincen≈øe, and new Wax, all Medicines devi≈øed by us, giving you charge, that before you begin to cure them, to ≈øeek out the right cau≈øe from whence it proceedeth, and ≈øo thou ≈øhalt help it with brevitie and great ea≈øe.</p>

The other cau≈øe is through opening of the Pores where the Urine doth pa≈ø≈øe; the which are ≈øo ≈øtretched or opened, that they cannot retain the Urine, becau≈øe the Urine is a voluntary motion, and a naturall motion together, they are hard to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, becau≈øe the naturall motion maketh his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie motion; ≈øo that Nature fir≈øt moveth the man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cometh the motion; for if a man would make water, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45531:46"/>
that Nature doth not move the motion, he cannot pi≈ø≈øe; for ≈øometime Nature doth not give his naturall motion becau≈øe of ≈øome impediment, for when a man cannot hold his water, it is a ≈øign that Nature hath no retention; and to redre≈ø≈øe the ≈øame, it were nece≈ø≈øarie to reduce Nature into good tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, ≈øo that it may retain the Urine; the which thing thou ≈øhalt doe with purging the bodie, and the ≈øtomack wherein is the matter that cau≈øeth that retention of Urine.

                     <p>THere is found a certain bird called <hi>Solone,</hi> of <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> in his Book of Secrets; the which birds are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plenteous in <hi>Rome,</hi> and are called <hi>Palmum bellae,</hi> and in <hi>Lumbardie, Sa≈ø≈øarvoli,</hi> the which in Engli≈øh I ≈øuppo≈øe, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Ring Dove, or Wood-colver, or the Stock Dove, which Birds are ≈øubject to the Stone, that if you keep them in a Cage, and feed them with ≈øuch meat as they commonly u≈øe, being deprived of their medicine, within the ≈øpace of four or ≈øix moneths at the mo≈øt, there will ingender a Stone in the belly ≈øo great, that their meat cannot pa≈ø≈øe through them, and ≈øo choaketh them, and they die, and that is becau≈øe the poor Bird cannot goe and help him≈øelf with that Medicine which Nature hath taught her. For tho≈øe that are at libertie in the field, flie unto the Sea-≈øide, and there they find a certain kind of ≈ømall ≈øtone very hard, the which ≈øtone hath vertue to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolve the ≈øtone in the bodie of the Bird, and this Bird knoweth

it by the in≈øtinct of Nature, and eateth great abundance of them, and ≈øo di≈ø≈øolveth the ≈øtone in their bellies, and live a long time after it without any trouble of the Stone. You ≈øhall under≈øtand, that this ≈øtone is unpo≈ø≈øible to be found in any other place, then in the belly of the ≈øaid bird, becau≈øe they are very little, and mans rea≈øon cannot di≈øcern them from other Stones, the which being beat in powder, with the flowers of Elders, and Cinnamon, of each a like, and given to drink with broth, in ≈øhort time it will di≈ø≈øolve the Stone, and cau≈øe them to avoid it with their Urine mo≈øt miraculou≈øly: But if you ask me the rea≈øon, I know not what I ≈øhall an≈øwer, but I hold it to be his proper hidden qualitie and vertue. For truly this I have taught to many, and have ≈øeen the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thereof ≈øundrie times, and it cured the mo≈øt part that did u≈øe it. For truely the vertue of Stones are very great unto tho≈øe that know them. I ≈øaw once two Stones in <hi>Rome</hi> of ine≈øtimable vertue; The one was a round Corall like unto the <hi>Serpentine Purphire,</hi> but therein was much green, and was of that vertue that being laid upon the fle≈øh of a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it cau≈øeth them to pi≈ø≈øe great abundance, ≈øo that it were to be wondred at. The other Stone was of <hi>Dia≈øper,</hi> but bright and thorough ≈øhining with certain white veins, and was of ≈øuch vertue, that being laid on a wound, pre≈øently the blood ≈øtench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ≈øo that there fell not down one drop, The which Stones were in the hand of an old Spaniard, who ≈øaid, he brought them out of <hi>India,</hi> from <hi>Nova Hi≈øpania.</hi> I have ≈øeen al≈øo divers and ≈øundry Stones of mo≈øt ≈øtrange vertues. You ≈øhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, that tho≈øe Stones of the Bird mu≈øt be gotten in this order. You ≈øhall get a number of the ≈øaid Birds, and take the ≈øtones out of their bellies, and wa≈øh them clean, and keep them to thy u≈øe. The quantitie is as much as you can hold upon a Sixpence, as well of the Stones as of the other matters: You ≈øhall drinke the ≈øaid quantitie ≈øeven or eight mornings together, and let your Diet be according, and drink good wine, and ≈øo in ≈øhort time you ≈øhall be helped.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>lcera ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida,</hi> becau≈øe therein is evill qualitie, and it appeareth but little, but it is evill to heal.

Nature and not to Art, and that is it which Dogs and other Animals doe u≈øe, who being wounded, u≈øe no other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine then to keep the wound clean with their proper tongues, and keep a Diet, and the re≈øt is left unto Nature which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth well without pains of Medicine, and this is the fir≈øt.

                     <p>HAving declared alreadie what wounds are outwardly, it is nece≈ø≈øary al≈øo to ≈øhew the true order to cure them with as much ea≈øe, and brevitie, as is po≈ø≈øible to be done: And fir≈øt, I will begin with ≈øimple wounds that are onely in the fle≈øh, without offence of vein, ≈øinew or bone. Although the≈øe ≈øorts of wounds are not to be helped with artifice, but onely to joyn the parts together, and if it be nece≈ø≈øary al≈øo to ≈øtitch them, and ≈øo leave it unto Nature, the which in ≈øhort time will heal it, neverthele≈ø≈øe if thou wilt help it with arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the fa≈øter, you ≈øhall annoint it once a day with oile of Frankincen≈øe made by Di≈øtillation, as is ≈øhewed in this Book. But tho≈øe wounds where there are veins cut, have need to be ≈øuccoured pre≈øently with ingenious artifice, and perfect Remedies to ea≈øe and heal them with the mo≈øt ≈øpeed that can be, becau≈øe the veins may joyn together, without greater offence of the wound, and this Mi≈øterie thou ≈øhalt doe in this order: The fir≈øt is to joyn the wound together quickly, and ≈øtitch
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45531:57"/>
it clo≈øe as they u≈øe to ≈øow bags, and not to leave great wide ≈øtitches as they mo≈øt commonly do; that being done, dre≈ø≈øe it upon the wound with our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> wetting therein a cloth, and laying it on as hot as you may ≈øuffer it, then ≈øtrew thereupon our ≈øecret powder, and al≈øo round about it, for that ≈øubtiliateth the matter that runneth to the wound, and taketh it forth with great ea≈øe, and without pain of the wound, and therefore this is one of the mo≈øt ≈øafe≈øt Remedies in that ca≈øe, that Nature with Art can make, and hath been proved an infinite of times by me, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies have had goodly experiences thereof. Al≈øo under≈øtand that the≈øe wounds, where the bones and ≈øinews are cut, have need of great artifice, for they are of great importance. But when there is offence onely of the ≈øinews, you ≈øhall ≈øtitch them pre≈øently, and doe as I have ≈øaid before of veins that were cut, but dre≈ø≈øe them not with <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> but in ≈øtead of that take <hi>Oleum Benedictum,</hi> and oil of Frankincen≈øe, of each alike, becau≈øe the≈øe Oiles doe comfort marvellou≈øly tho≈øe ≈øinews that are cut. If it chance ≈øo, that a ≈øinew had a puncture, or cut half away, in that ca≈øe it is nece≈ø≈øarie to cut it overthwart, le≈øt it ≈øhould bring a Spa≈øm in the wound. But in ca≈øe afterward that the bone be offended, and that there be ≈øome part to come forth, it were nece≈ø≈øary to leave the wound open untill the bone be come forth, and then incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it; and this thou ≈øhalt doe with our <hi>Bal≈øamo Artificiato,</hi> and lay thereon the Cerot of <hi>Godfredo di medi,</hi> the which hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth with great ≈øpeed. And this is the order wherewith thou maye≈øt help all tho≈øe ≈øorts of wounds before named, and the defen≈øive to u≈øe in the≈øe wounds is this. Take perfect <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> made of good Wine, and put therein <hi>Hypericon, Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folly, Viticella, Betonie,</hi> and with that Infu≈øion wet clothes, and lay them for a defen≈øive round about the wound, and thou ≈øhalt have good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe. Wounds in the head are hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the order, as tho≈øe in whom the Sinews are offended.

                     <p>VVOunds in the head, where there is offence of the brain, are mortall: and there is no Phy≈øician that will take them in cure, but he counteth them dead men without any hope. But I by the grace of God and gift of Nature, have found the order to cure and heal them in ≈øhort time. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that when one was wounded in the head in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Citie of <hi>Naples,</hi> yea, although the brain were not hurt, but that the skin were cut unto the bone, they counted him mortall, but I dre≈ø≈øed them, and clo≈øed their wounds, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in ≈øhort ≈øpace, ≈øo that they wondred thereat; and that order I u≈øed for the ≈øpace of ≈øeven yeers that I tarried there, and cau≈øed them to walk in the ≈øtreets, as it is well known unto all tho≈øe that dwell there. And among a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other, I cured a Portingall that was called, <hi>Il Seignior Diego di mena,</hi> of whom I took away all the bone of the forehead, and every day he came to my lodging to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which I did with great ≈øpeed, ≈øo that it cau≈øed every one to marvell thereat. Afterward I went to <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Pope Paulus</hi> the iiii. Carafa, and alwaies I cured in the ≈øame order, and did miracles, of which I call to te≈øtimonie the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And among the re≈øt, I cured a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>M. Ale≈ø≈øandor</hi> (I cannot remember his Sirname) who was wounded in divers places, and I cured him quickly. After that I cured, and that in ≈øhort time, a young man that was in manner cut in pieces, and of that <hi>M. Jacomo da Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia, M. Ale≈ø≈øandro da Civita, M.

                     <p>VVOunds in the Head, with Fracture of the bone, of the common Phy≈øicians and Chirurgians, are counted dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile to be healed, becau≈øe thereunto belongeth great art or cunning, for they open the fle≈øh and ra≈øpe the bone, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, of which here I account it ≈øuperfluous to treat of, becau≈øe that many be helped without them. For alwayes when the Phy≈øitian or Chirurgian, doth defend the wound from alteration and corruption, nature it ≈øelf will work very well, and heal it without any other aid; but with our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines they may be helped with much more ≈øpeed, becau≈øe they let the alteration, and defendeth them from Putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mittigateth the pain, and the order to cure tho≈øe kinds of wounds is thus: The fir≈øt thing that is to be done in tho≈øe wounds is, to joyn the parts clo≈øe together, and

dre≈ø≈øe them upon the wound with our <hi>Oleum Benedictum,</hi> and upon the oile lay clothes wet in our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> as hot as you may ≈øuffer it, and ≈øo with the≈øe Remedies thou ≈øhalt help them quickly, becau≈øe our <hi>Oleum Benedictum</hi> taketh away the pains, and keepeth it from putrifaction, and repercu≈ø≈øeth: Our <hi>Magno liquore</hi> dige≈øteth, mundifieth, and incarnateth, and healeth.

                     <p>VVOunds in the head where the bone is not hurt, are not of ≈øo great Importance, but are ea≈øie to be helped; for you ≈øhall need to doe nothing, but to keep it from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction, and defend it from inflammation, which are ea≈øie to be done, and ≈øo Nature will work well with great ≈øpeed.

                     <p>VVOunds in the neck are very perilous, and hard to be cured, and long before they will heal: and this cometh becau≈øe in it are all the ligaments of the head, as bones, ≈øinewes, veins, fle≈øh, and skin, all in≈øtruments that hold the head and the body together, without the which a man cannot live: and therefore tho≈øe wounds are ≈øo perilous to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ≈øeeing thereunto runneth ≈øo great quantity of humours, that they will not ≈øuffer the wound to be healed.

For where the ≈øinew parts be hurt, there ari≈øeth ever great pain, which for the mo≈øt part bringeth Fevers, and other accidents, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is evill to cure. The cure of them is with our <hi>Bal≈øamo</hi> and <hi>Quinta e≈ø≈øentia.</hi> For the one taketh away the pain, and the other keepeth from alteration.

is offended or hurt. Either the Liver, or the Lungs, or the Milt, or any other particulars. Moreover, there is another matter which maketh it dangerous, which is, when they are penetrating, the matter that proceedeth from the Wound falleth into the body, as well as out.

                     <p>VVOunds in the belly are doubtfull, and very uncertain to cure, becau≈øe it is unpo≈ø≈øible to know how they are, or of what importance they be: for although yee may ≈øee the Orifice where the Weapon went in, yet yee cannot know what offence it hath done in the interiour parts, and therefore they are bard to be helped, and wor≈øe to judge of, and for that cau≈øe I will not ≈øtand long in rea≈øoning thereof: for I have determined not to ≈øpeak of things uncertain and doubtfull, but onely of things that may be proved by rea≈øon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And becau≈øe tho≈øe wounds be uncertain, I will write nothing of them, for fear of hiding the truth: but I will write of tho≈øe in the reines or back, and fir≈øt I will ≈øhew what the reines are, becau≈øe every one may comprehend my rea≈øon. It is to be under≈øtood, that our bodies are made all of ≈øen≈øible things: as inwardly, the Stomack, the Heart, the Liver, the Lungs, the Belly, the Milt, the Guts, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other things which are not common, or known to all men, as tho≈øe which I have ≈øpoken of. The re≈øt of the man is made of Cartilagines, of Veines, of Muskles, of Fle≈øh,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45531:61"/>
of Skin, and other particulars of ≈ømall importance to know, becau≈øe the wi≈øe, learned, and reverend, my Lord <hi>Canan Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare≈øe,</hi> hath writ thereof better then ever any in the world hath done, and therefore if you beleeve not me, beleeve his writing ≈øet forth in print. But to return to our purpo≈øe, I ≈øay, that God hath compounded the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n naturally of all the≈øe things that I have ≈øpoken of: and becau≈øe they are ≈øoft and tender, he hath placed the bones in the midde≈øt of them to ≈øtrengthen them, and to keep them ≈øtreight, &amp;c. And from the ≈øhoulder to the thigh, he hath made a great pillar, of many peices of bones joyned together: On the one part whereof groweth the ribs, which holdeth the fle≈øh, skin, and other particulars farre from the interiours: and upon that bone on the outward ≈øide, are the magi≈øtrall ≈øinewes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcend from the head, and bind all the back together, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down unto the feet. Therefore (this being true that I have ≈øaid) wounds in the head are very dangerous in all his actions, and their cure very hard, becau≈øe all tho≈øe ≈øences that give nouri≈øhment, pa≈ø≈øe by the reines downward to the lower parts: and mo≈øt commonly when a man is wounded in tho≈øe places, he remaineth lame on the leg that is on that part, and being, as it is, hard and dangerous, the cure of it, according to the Canons of the Ancients, is al≈øo perilous; becau≈øe in tho≈øe places where ≈øo many particulars doe meet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, there ought not in any wi≈øe to be putrifaction, or dige≈øtion, but to pre≈øerve: You may not bring it to maturation, but to keep it from it; you may not incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but with ≈øpeed heal it up: and ≈øo in this order the cure ≈øhall ≈øucceed well, and without danger. And this I will ≈øhew unto every one, becau≈øe he ≈øhall profit by our doctrine to the glory of God, and health of the wounded. When one is wounded in tho≈øe parts, I coun≈øell that the Chirurgian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently ≈øhall clo≈øe the wound with all his diligence, putting thereupon of our <hi>Quinta e≈ø≈øentia,</hi> and in≈øtead of a defen≈øive our <hi>Bal≈øamo,</hi> and upon the wound lay a cloth wet in our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and upon the cloth ≈øtrew our ≈øecret powder for wounds, and following this order, he ≈øhall be reputed for an excellent Chirurgian above all other: and this is the meer

And the≈øe when they are offended, or wounded, are very perilous, becau≈øe unto them runneth great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of humours. And in the Legs are certain deadly places as a man may ≈øay: As the hinder part of the Caulf of the Leg: And the middle of the inner ≈øide of the thigh: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and the foot are all places trouble≈øome and curious to heal, when they are wounded. And therefore to heal them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the Ancients, it were great trouble to the Chirurgian, and pittie to ≈øee the pain of the Patient.

Fir≈øt, joyn the parts clo≈øe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and put therein our Quinte≈ø≈øence, and lay thereon a cloth, wet in our Balm, and bind it fa≈øt that the air get not in, for it is very hurtfull.

                     <p>THe teeth being black and ru≈øtie, and full of filth, and the Gums putrified or corrupt, are the wor≈øt things that may be ≈øeen in man or woman, and are al≈øo very unwhol≈øome; and the Remedie to make the teeth white, and to help the gumms, is thus: Make this water, and u≈øe it in this order as I will ≈øhew thee.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Sal Gemmae,</hi> Roch Allum, Brim≈øtone of each two pound, Borax ‚Ñ•. x. Pearl beat fine, Corall, each ‚Ñ•. ii. Pure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtilled Vinegar ‚Ñ•. iiii. Put all the afore≈øaid matters in a Goord, with his head and receiver, and give it fire accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Art, and at the la≈øt there will come forth a white wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like Milk, the which after it hath ≈øtood a while, will waxe clear. You ≈øhall under≈øtand, that this water is above all other waters in the world, to help Ulcers in the mouth, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate the gums, and to make the teeth white, and cau≈øeth a good breath in tho≈øe which are troubled with the afore≈øaid matters. For of this water I have made great quantitie, and it hath been carried into <hi>Spain,</hi> into <hi>Almain,</hi> into <hi>Poland,</hi> into <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> and in divers other Countries, as though it had been a Divine thing, and not material.</p>
                     <p>For truly this experience doth cau≈øe the world to wonder at it, the u≈øe hereof I have written in this Book, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I will write it again in ≈øome of my Books, where oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion ≈øhall ≈øerve to u≈øe it in cures.</p>

                     <p>THere are many ≈øorts of Unguents that are found out, of which I beleeve that many Chirurgians are greatly abu≈øed of their operation, but for that which I doe finde, that ≈øome ≈øorts of Unguents are occupied for one effect, and they work another; as for example, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nguento Camphorato</hi> which many doe occupie to cool hot ≈øores, in ≈øtead of cooling heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them more then they were before, which cometh by means of the <hi>Camphire</hi> which is a hot ≈øub≈øtance, as I will prove by ≈øufficient rea≈øon that it cannot be denied. For you ≈øhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand, that into <hi>

oyle, both hot materials, as for experience: Take <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire</hi> and lay it by the fire, or ≈øet it nigh a candle, and thou ≈øhalt perceive, that a≈ø≈øoon as it feeleth the heat, it will flie into the fire and burn fiercely; and the like will the Oyle do; for if you wet a cloth therein and hold it over the fire, pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it will burn, which are manife≈øt ≈øigns that they be both hot, becu≈øe they are friends unto the fire; whereas if they were cold and moi≈øt, the fire would not burn them with ≈øuch force. As for example, take water, earth, ≈øtones, and mettals that are cold and moi≈øt, and lay them on the fire, and you ≈øhall ≈øee that the flame of a candle ≈øhall not be able to kindle the fire with ≈øuch ea≈øe as it doth with the <hi>Camphire</hi> and oyle. So that you may ≈øee that <hi>Camphire</hi> and Oyle are hot and friends unto the fire which is mo≈øt hot, and earth, ≈øtones, and mettalls, are moi≈øt and cold, and are enemies unto the fire, and therefore I conclude, that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nguento Camphorato</hi> is very hot, and cannot by any meanes cool hot Ulcers. Al≈øo <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum Apo≈øtolorum</hi> is a compo≈øition in which there is put <hi>Verdigriece,</hi> a materiall which is mo≈øt enemie unto the ≈øore, for laying it thereto cau≈øeth great pain, as you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand of tho≈øe that have proved it, and in my judgement this is no Unguent to be laid on a ≈øore, becau≈øe they cannot ≈øuffer it, neither is it po≈ø≈øible to heal the ≈øore with that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, for that it corrodeth the fle≈øh and will not let it heal. Al≈øo <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nguento de minio</hi> is a mixture not very profitable for Ulcers, becau≈øe it is too much drying; for applying it unto a ≈øore that is not mundified, it drieth it in <hi>Superficie,</hi> ≈øo that if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ≈øend humours unto tho≈øe parts, and they find no exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or vent by rea≈øon of that drying, it will cau≈øe the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of abundance of humours, and be a means of greater mi≈øchief: But if the ≈øore be well mundified and clean≈øed, you ≈øhall have little need of that Unguent, becau≈øe Nature will doe it alone without any other help, ≈øo that this Unguent is of ≈ømall profit to be u≈øed of any. But to the contrary, there are many ≈øorts of Unguents which are mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary to dre≈ø≈øe ≈øores, as <hi>

                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nguento Ro≈øato</hi> doth mittigate the pains of foul Scabs.

                     <p>THe beard and hair commonly doe fall through two cau≈øes, the one is, when the Patient hath a Pe≈øtilent Fever, that is, <hi>Mal di Mazzucco,</hi> for when they are cured, all their hair will fall away, and many times mo≈øt of them doe change that ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile skin, called of the Doctors <hi>Epiderma,</hi> and this is one of the cau≈øes: The other cau≈øe is, when they accompany with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean women, and that they get tho≈øe <hi>Carvoli</hi> on the Yeard, the which as ≈øoon as they are cured, there cometh an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the throat, ≈øo that they cannot well eat their meat, then after that in ≈øhort time the hair will begin to fall, and the≈øe are the two cau≈øes of falling of the hair. In that which commeth after <hi>Mal di Mazzucco,</hi> ye ≈øhall need nothing el≈øe but to annoint the head when yee goe to bed, with our <hi>Oleum Philo≈øophorum</hi> a little warm, and that will cau≈øe the hair to grow, re≈øtore the ≈øight and hearing, the which tho≈øe commonly doe lo≈øe when they are ≈øick, through their long ≈øickne≈ø≈øe. But when the hair doth fall through the other cau≈øe, yee mu≈øt u≈øe forcible Medicines to cau≈øe it to come again, and that thou ≈øhalt doe with this Cerot.

                     <p>THis Sirrup being well made, is of marvellous vertue for tho≈øe women that are troubled with pains of the Mother, and pains cau≈øed of wind and cold, becau≈øe the Bayes of their nature are hot and drying, and re≈øolveth the wind, and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cold, and drieth the humidity, ≈øo that who≈øoever doth u≈øe this Sirrup oftentimes, ≈øhall be free from the ≈øtitch in the ≈øide, and gravell in the Reins, becau≈øe it doth mundifie the Reins, and re≈øolve the humour hanging, and therefore this would be u≈øed in <hi>Polonia,</hi> and <hi>Almaign</hi> with great profit, becau≈øe tho≈øe Countries are cold, and they feed on mo≈øt meats which are contrary to tho≈øe afore≈øaid infirmities, and the order to make it is thus. Take a branch of Bayes weighing one pound, and put it in a gla≈ø≈øe with eight pound of white Wine, and two pound of purified Hony, and di≈øtill it in <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> three hours, then take it from the fire, and keep that by it ≈øelf, then take that which remained in the gla≈ø≈øe, and di≈øtill it by a filter three or four times untill it be clear, then take two pound of Sugar, and clarifie it with the white of an Egge,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45531:82"/>
and then mix it with that which yee di≈øtilled by a filter, and give it a little walme or two, but not too much, then when it is boyled, before it be cold, put therein the ≈øaid water that yee di≈øtilled in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and aromati≈øe it with ≈øix graines of Musk, and ‚Ñà. i. of Cloves, and another of Saffron, and <g ref="char:dram"> í</g>. ≈øs. of Cinamon, and ‚Ñ•. iii. of Ro≈øewater, and then keep it in a gla≈ø≈øe clo≈øe ≈øtopped, and it will pre≈øerve a long time: The do≈øe of this Sirrup is from ‚Ñ•. i. to ‚Ñ•. ii. and no more.

                     </head>
                     <p>THis Magi≈øtrall Sirrup is of ≈øuch vertue in his operation, that it will help the <hi>Mal' France≈øe,</hi> if it be made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order, and taken as it ≈øhould be: And the order to make it is thus.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Lignum Sanctum</hi> ra≈øped ‚Ñ•. vi. the Bark of the ≈øame ‚Ñ•. iiii. and lay it to infu≈øe in twelve pound of good white wine, with one pound of white honey, then di≈øtill it untill ye have received three pound, then take it from the fire, and keep the water by it ≈øelf; then take that which remained in the gla≈ø≈øe, and di≈øtill it by a filter untill it be clear, then put thereto the water that ye di≈øtilled away, and for every pound of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter put thereunto ‚Ñ•. iii. of Julep ≈øimple, and mix them well together, and keep it in a Bottle of gla≈ø≈øe well ≈øtopped, for this is marvellous in the cure where Sweatings is needfull: For if ye give five or ≈øixe ounces of this, as hot as he may ≈øuffer it, and cover him in the bed, he ≈øhall ≈øweat marvellou≈øly, the which ≈øweating re≈øolveth cold tumours, pains, and divers other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øpo≈øitions, that are to be re≈øolved by ≈øweat. And as for the cure of the Pox, this is a mo≈øt ≈øoveraign remedie, when there are tumours, or pains, or inflations. But when there are Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Scabbs, or Inflammations, in that ca≈øe you may not u≈øe it by any means, becau≈øe it is very hot, and will cau≈øe greater inflammation. And therefore if any will u≈øe this Sirrup to cure pains, ≈øwellings, or inflammations, it were nece≈ø≈øarie fir≈øt to take our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> written in this Book, with divers other Medicines of our Invention, that being done, let him take ≈øeven or eight times our <hi>Sirrupo ≈øolutivo,,</hi> and then begin to take this Sirrup, and ≈øweat thereon morning and evening: His meat ≈øhall be ro≈øt Mutton, or a Bird, Rai≈øins, Dates, Almonds, and ≈øuch like, but he mu≈øt not eat too much. His bread ≈øhall be Bisket, and his drink good wine at meals, and if it doe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that he be bound in the body, yee ≈øhall give him every week once our <hi>Sirrupo Solutivo,</hi> and ≈øo continue with his ≈øweating untill he be helped.</p>

                     <p>THis Sirrup of Juniper Berries is of great vertue, becau≈øe it is one of tho≈øe fruits that continueth green all the year: of the which hearbs I have written a di≈øcour≈øe in my book called <hi>La Phy≈øica del Phioravante,</hi> and the order to make it is thus.</p>
                     <p>Take Juniper Berries when they begin to wax black four pound, and ≈øtamp them, and infu≈øe them in twelve pound of ≈øtrong white Wine ≈øix dayes, then di≈øtill it with two pound of white Hony, and ‚Ñ•. i. of Cinnamon, untill yee have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived two pound, then take it from the fire, and ≈øtrain out the Fe≈ø≈øes that remained with a pre≈ø≈øe, then ≈øtrain it by a filter again, then with Sugar make a Sirrup in good form, and when it is boiled, put therein the ≈øaid water di≈øtilled from the berries, and ≈øo without fire incorporate them well together, and keep it in a gla≈ø≈øe clo≈øe ≈øhut that it take no air: the do≈øe is an ounce and a half to be taken warm. This is excellent for tho≈øe that are troubled with wind, or coldne≈ø≈øe of the ≈øtomack, becau≈øe it warmeth, drieth, and helpeth dige≈øtion, and therefore this would work miraculous effects in <hi>Almaign,</hi> becau≈øe it is a cold Region, and that they eat many moi≈øt meats, the which Nature cannot well dige≈øt: It is al≈øo appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate again≈øt pains of the Mother, becau≈øe it provoketh <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrua,</hi> and purgeth the Matrix, and helpeth dige≈øtion, and cau≈øeth ≈øleep, with divers other vertues.</p>

                     <p>Take as it were a Hog≈øhead or a Barrell of good white Wine, that containeth about eighteen gallons of Wine, in the which yee ≈øhall put <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> ‚Ñ•. ii. <hi>Saxifrage</hi> ‚Ñ•. vi. <hi>Walwort</hi> ‚Ñ•. iiii. <hi>Pollipodie</hi> ‚Ñ•. iiii.

                     <p>Take <hi>Pollipodie</hi> two ounces, Sene one ounce, <hi>Lignum Aloes</hi> half an ounce, mix the≈øe well together in a ≈øtone morter, then take white Wine as much as yee will, and for every pound of Wine put thereto ‚Ñ•. i. of that mixture, and ≈øo let it ≈øtand four and twenty hours, and then drink it, for it will purge without any pain, tho≈øe that have any indi≈øpo≈øition of the ≈øtomack, weakne≈ø≈øe of the legs, and faintne≈ø≈øe of the body, and ≈øuch like.

                     <p>THis Hearb <hi>Millefolie,</hi> is well known unto mo≈øt men; and of many is little e≈øteemed, becau≈øe it groweth ≈øo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among≈øt us. This Hearb being green, is a miraculous and divine remedie, to help any ≈øorts of fre≈øh and bleeding wounds, if ye ≈øtamp a handfull thereof, and lay it thereupon the lips being clo≈øe joyned together, within the ≈øpace of four and twentie-houres it ≈øhall be perfectly whole. If yee drinke three ounces of the juyce of this Hearb with new Milk, morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, it will help <hi>Gonorrea</hi> in ≈øhort time. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo an excellent remedie for tho≈øe that have their Liver and Lungs ulcerated, for this I have proved divers and ≈øundry times in Goats, the which are troubled with a certain infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, the which is called <hi>Bi≈ø≈øole</hi> of the Goat-keepers, for they are certain Impo≈øthumes that doe ingender in the Liver and the Lungs, and cau≈øeth them to die. I then ≈øeeing that in the interiour parts of the Goats, made this experience, I took <hi>Millefolie</hi> made in powder, and gave it unto the Goats with Salt, and for the mo≈øt part they were helped; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I cured a number of men and women of that di≈øea≈øe, for of that infirmity there die a great number in the world. And with the ≈øaid order afore≈øaid, thou maye≈øt ≈øave a number, but it mu≈øt be mixed with <hi>Sal artificiato Leonardo.</hi> Tho≈øe that are <hi>Ettici</hi> and <hi>Te≈øici</hi> die commonly through Impo≈øthumes

and Ulcers that are cau≈øed in the Liver, for of this I have ≈øeen above an hundred. For after they were dead, I have cau≈øed them to be opened to ≈øee the experience. You ≈øhall under≈øtand, that this Hearb <hi>Millefolie</hi> hath a great propertie to heal tho≈øe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. And therefore the Chirurgian that under≈øtandeth not Phy≈øick, can ill help tho≈øe Ulcers inwardly, becau≈øe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply his Unguents and Plai≈øters, as he doth outwardly. And tho≈øe kind of Ulcers cannot be known, but of tho≈øe which have ≈øeen them, and have ≈øeen the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of their di≈øea≈øes, and therefore I may well di≈øcour≈øe thereof, becau≈øe of them have pa≈ø≈øed a great number through my hands, and I have ≈øeen them with mine eyes.

Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe, I will not let to ≈øhew one experiment of it, the which is marvellous, and is this: Take a Capon, and pull away all his feathers from his brea≈øt, and beat him with Nettles, and he will call in the young Chickens, and govern them like the Hen. Nettles being dried and made into powder, and given to eat unto a man, it will provoke venereous acts, being u≈øed to be eaten in meats, it purgeth the Matrix, it helpeth ≈øcabs, if you wa≈øh them with his decoction, and mittigateth all pains coming of cold, making a bath thereof; his decoction helpeth the tooth-ach, with many other vertues that I have not proved.

                     <p>FIr≈øt I will ≈øpeak of Wine and his qualities. You ≈øhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand, that Wine is a liquour the which changeth into divers kinds differing from his own nature: And fir≈øt it changeth into Vineger of it ≈øelf without any artifice, the which can never be turned into Wine again. Al≈øo they ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Wine <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> the which being ≈øeparated can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be turned into Wine again. Al≈øo Wine maketh, by ≈øetling it ≈øelf, a certain ≈øtone called Tartar, the which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be turned into Wine again, nor yet into Vineger. And thus when the workman doth tran≈ømute or change it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be turned again into his fir≈øt quality. Wine is very apt to corrupt, and to change into other kinds, but after that it changeth or tran≈ømuteth, it is uncorruptible: for when it is turned into Vineger, it is apt to con≈øerve all things. Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Animall that is put therein, but not the Minerals, for by nature it is enemy unto them. There is al≈øo ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Wine <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> the which is con≈øervatrix of all Medicines; for when it is circulated and made into a <hi>Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈ø≈øence</hi> it becometh cele≈øtiall, as I have ≈øhewed in my other books, and therewith thou maye≈øt help many infirmities, becau≈øe it mittigateth all pains, and di≈ø≈øolveth in a manner all infirmities, and e≈øpecially when it is compounded in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take of that <hi>Quinte≈ø≈øence</hi> four parts, Oil of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Vitrioll</hi> of each one part, Julep of Violets ≈øixty parts: Mix them all together, and it will be of ≈øuch vertue, that if yee give <g ref="char:dram"> í</g>. i. thereof to drink to one that lay at the point of death, it would recover him, becau≈øe it breaketh choller, pre≈øerveth the ≈øtomack, cau≈øeth an appetite, and helpeth any ≈øort of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and pre≈øerveth both men and women in lu≈øty ≈øtate, if they

u≈øe it oftentimes; for the≈øe experiences I have ≈øeen divers times. Al≈øo of the Tartar yee may may make Oyle, the which is of marvellous vertue, both in Phy≈øick, Chirurgerie, and Alchimie. There is al≈øo drawn forth of Tartar, his ≈øpirit and oyle in this order, as <hi>Andernacus</hi> writeth, the which is mo≈øt profitable again≈øt ≈øundry infirmities, and the order to make it is thus.</p>
                     <p>Take white Tartar and beat it to powder four pound, and put it into a ≈øtone pot or gla≈ø≈øe well luted, and ≈øet it in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to di≈øtill with a great Receiver clo≈øe luted, lea≈øt all the fumes come forth or break the gla≈ø≈øe, then give it fir≈øt a ≈ømall fire, and ≈øo increa≈øe it as though thou woulde≈øt draw a ≈øtrong water, and ≈øo continue it untill there come forth no more ≈øpirits, then let it wax cold, and take forth the liquor, and put it into an upright gla≈ø≈øe with his head and receiver, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtill away the water in <hi>Balneo,</hi> then take that oyle which is in the bottome, and di≈øtill it in Sand or A≈øhes, and there will come forth at the fir≈øt a yellowi≈øh oyle, and ≈øo by little and little it will change colour, and become blacker and blacker, and thick like unto a Balme, or a Sirrup.

                     <p>VInegar is made of wine, and of water. Whereas there is wine, they make it of wine, but in tho≈øe Countries where there groweth no wine, they make it of beer and ale, in ≈øtead of wine, the which Vinegar is very ≈øtrong. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, it hath not the vertue and qualitie of that which is made of wine, becau≈øe his nature is to pre≈øerve tho≈øe things which are put therein, as is ≈øaid before. If yee doe di≈øtill Vinegar in <hi>Balneo</hi> untill it remain drie, and then burn tho≈øe Fe≈ø≈øes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they come white, and then lay them in a moi≈øt place, it will turn into Oyle, the which is of ≈øuch vertue for mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that it is not to be credited, for if yee give thereof a ≈ømall quantitie to drink, it will di≈ø≈øolve the Gravel, and Stone in the Bladder.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hirurgery is both Science and practi≈øe, and to ≈øay the truth, he that will know the compo≈øition of mans body, mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity have ≈øome Science, and be Anatomi≈øt, although the ≈øame Science be a thing to be learned by practi≈øe, for I have ≈øeen many times, tho≈øe which were unlearned, to be expert in the Anatomy of mans body, and tho≈øe were Painters and Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the which was nece≈ø≈øary for them to know to frame their figures accordingly: and therefore I take not that for Science, but practi≈øe: For Science is onely that wherewith the cau≈øes of every infirmity is found out, and is of ≈ømall effect to our purpo≈øe, becau≈øe Chirurgery helpeth not onely the cau≈øe, but al≈øo the effect after it is known, and therefore I may ≈øay, that Chirurgery is no other then a pure and meer practi≈øe, and that it is onely nece≈ø≈øary for the Chirurgian to know how to ≈øtitch a Wound well, to mundifie an Ulcer, and to keep it from putrifaction, and keep it from alteration, ≈øo that there run no evill humours unto the place offended, and to know all kind of Unguents that are apt to heal all kind of Wounds and Ulcers, which thing mu≈øt be known by practi≈øe, And likewi≈øe to make all manner of Unguents nece≈ø≈øary for Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, and for that cau≈øe I conclude mo≈øt truly, that our Chirurgery is onely practi≈øe or experience.

it is a ≈øign that I have ≈øaid the truth, and ≈øo conclude, that Chirurgery is a practi≈øe to help ≈øores on mens bodies, and al≈øo on bea≈øts, when occa≈øion ≈øhall ≈øerve.</p>

                     <head>What Wounds are.</head>
                     <p>VVOunds are tho≈øe which in Latine are called <hi>Vulnus,</hi> and of the vulgar <hi>Vulnera,</hi> and they are of two kinds, that is, ≈øimple, and compound. The ≈øimple are tho≈øe that are onely in the fle≈øh, the compound are tho≈øe where are cut Sinewes, Veins, Mu≈øckles, and Bones, and the≈øe are of divers and ≈øundry kinds, And the difference that is among them is, by the variety of the place where they are wounded, and by the difference of the weapon wherewith they were hurt, for ≈øome goe right, ≈øome overthwart, ≈øome long, ≈øome broad, ≈øome are thru≈øts or ≈øtocate, that offend divers parts of the body. The ≈øimple are of ≈ømall importance, becau≈øe if yee keep them clean and clo≈øe ≈øhut, nature will heal them without any kind of Medicine. But tho≈øe, where Veins are cut, have need of ≈øome art or practi≈øe, with the which they may ≈øtop the bloud, and in any wi≈øe not to ≈øuffer the wound to remain open, but to ≈øow it up very clo≈øe, ≈øo that the Vein may heal. Al≈øo tho≈øe where Sinews are hurt are of great importance, and would be healed with great ≈øpeed, ≈øo that the Sinews may joyn with more ea≈øe. But tho≈øe where Bones are hurt, are of greater importance, for if the Bone be ≈øeparated from the other, of nece≈ø≈øity it mu≈øt be taken forth before the Wound be healed. So that by this means every one may know what Wounds are, and their kinds.</p>

But fir≈øt I will write of tho≈øe kind of Ulcers that are cau≈øed of Wounds.

                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>lcera putrida,</hi> that is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, and it is becau≈øe it is filthy and ≈øtinketh. But when it is neither cancrenated, nor yet apo≈øthumated, but that through ≈øome evill di≈øpo≈øition the wound is clo≈øed, and that there cometh in it evill qualities without alteration, then it is called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>lcera ≈øordida,</hi> becau≈øe therein is evill qualitie, and it appeareth but a little, but it is evill to heal. There be other ≈øorts of Ulcers al≈øo, the which are cau≈øed of divers and ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry kinds of tumours, and the mo≈øt evill and mi≈øchievous are tho≈øe that are of tumours cau≈øed of the Pox, for unto tho≈øe there runneth abundance of evill humours that augment the Ulcer, and they be the wor≈øt ≈øort, for they cannot be healed by them≈øelves, except the body be well purged and evacuated of all the humours that are offen≈øive.

                     <head>An order to u≈øe in healing all manner of Di≈øea≈øes appertaining unto the Chirurgian.</head>
                     <p>VVOunds and all other ≈øorts of ≈øores, are of ≈øundry and divers kinds, as is afore≈øaid, neverthele≈ø≈øe the order to helpe them is not much different one from the other, if we ≈øhould ≈øay onely the truth without abu≈øe. For yee ≈øhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand, that Nature is the ma≈øter of all things created, and the Phy≈øitian and Chirurgian are helpers of that Nature, as the antient Profe≈ø≈øors of the Art have affirmed. Then ≈øeeing this is ≈øo, what need we to make ≈øuch adoe, having Nature that worketh ≈øo gently, if it be not hindered by the Mini≈øter, and therefore if we will ≈øpeak of Wounds, I ≈øay, that the Mini≈øter hath three operations to doe and no more, and the re≈øt leave to Nature that worketh gently. The three operations that the Ma≈øter hath to doe are the≈øe: To defend the Wound ≈øo that there runneth no humours to it, and that it putrfie not, and to keep it clean, and when the Mini≈øter hath done that, let Nature work that which ≈øhe will work well, and if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire to ≈øee if it will be ≈øo in effect, yee may ≈øee by a Dog, for if he hath a great wound upon his body, he healeth it without any Medicine, onely with diet, and keeping it clean with his tongue, and this is mo≈øt true, that tho≈øe which doe help Wounds by inchantment, doe nothing but keep the Wound clean, and cau≈øe the Patient to keep a diet, and ≈øo nature work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as well on a Man as on a Dog, therefore let none marvell of this authority of a Dog, although I approve the like of a Chri≈øtian. But for ≈øo much as it would be good to help Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it might work with more ≈øpeedine≈ø≈øe, as Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gardners doe, who becau≈øe they would have Nature to work the better, and quicker in their ground, doe ca≈øt thereon divers ≈øorts of dungs, &amp;c. The which is done onely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45531:119"/>
to help Nature to work the quicker, and to conclude, I ≈øay, that the Chirurgian ≈øhould doe the ≈øame in helping of Wounds. But as for Ulcers of divers ≈øorts, it were nece≈ø≈øary to find out the cau≈øe, becau≈øe they come of divers cau≈øes, for when the cau≈øe is found, it will be more ea≈øie to be helped, becau≈øe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers cannot come but by great di≈øtemperance of Nature in our bodies, as by great heat or cold, or by repletions of the body. Therefore in this ca≈øe it is nece≈ø≈øary to purge the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Fir≈øt, to ea≈øe Nature which is offended, and to extingui≈øh the ≈øuperfluous heat or cold that is in the bodie: That being done, the mini≈øter or helper of Nature hath three things to doe. The fir≈øt is to mortifie or kill the ≈øore, the ≈øecond to mundifie, and the third to incarnate, and then Nature will cicatrize it, and the≈øe three operations are to be u≈øed in Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Al≈øo Impo≈øthumes are cau≈øed of divers accidents, in the which it is al≈øo nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øeek out the cau≈øe, whereby to know what purgations are fit to purge the body of the ≈øuperfluous humours, and then the Mini≈øter hath three things to doe in that ca≈øe. Fir≈øt to bring it to maturation quickly, then when it is ripe and broke, to mundifie it well, and thirdly to incarnate it, and the≈øe are the three operations that are to be done in an Impo≈øthume to help Nature to work well, and ≈øo following this order thy work ≈øhall prove well, and goe the right way, as hereafter I will ≈øhew in his place, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to u≈øe in the effect, with the order to help them, and al≈øo to make thy Unguents, ≈øhewing their quality and vertue, and will prove by rea≈øon tho≈øe things that are doubtfull, ≈øo that every one ≈øhall be ≈øatisfied in that matter.</p>

when we were in the mid≈øt of the gulf between <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Palermo,</hi> there happened a great mi≈ø-fortune, the which was thus.</p>
                     <p>In the Gallie of <hi>Si.

that nature cannot prevail to conglutinate or ≈øoder the fle≈øh together; and thus, through want of natural heat, the wound falleth to Impo≈øthumation, <hi>Gangrena,</hi> Fi≈øtulaes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and can hardly be cured. The ≈øecond cau≈øe is, the keeping of them too much open, by rea≈øon of their tents or pledgets, ≈øo that they cannot joyn together again, but grow to Cancers and Fi≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes, whereupon many times the Patient remaineth lame ever after, or el≈øe ≈øpeedy death is the end thereof.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45531:194"/>
they are not yet come perfectly to know all the cau≈øe of this infirmity: for I ≈øee, that in the cures, which the≈øe Theoricks would perform, it falleth not out according to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and de≈øire, for that they know not the whole, or the principall cau≈øe of the malady, therefore what certain Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine can they find out to cure the infirmity? They may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance (as the blind man hits the Crow) help they know not what; which thing I ≈øpeak not to back-bite or injury any of them, but to tell them, out of love that I bear to them and others, the whole and true cau≈øe of that, whereof heretofore they have been ignorant. The fir≈øt cau≈øe is putrified bloud in <hi>Leonichi:</hi> The ≈øecond is the vapours that a≈øcend from the ≈øtomack and offend the head: The third is the humidity or moi≈øture between the skin and the fle≈øh: So that the cau≈øes are three, and the remedies as many to di≈ø≈øolve the <hi>Antecedent</hi> cau≈øes. I have now ≈øhewed thee the originall and root of the pain in the head, about which thou ≈øhalt never more need to beat thy head, or break thy brains, either in ≈øeeking the <hi>Aphori≈ømes</hi> of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> the <hi>Commentary</hi> of <hi>Galen,</hi> or the Authority of <hi>Avicen,</hi> for in the≈øe four or few words I have ≈øaid all. Now of the cure of this di≈øea≈øe, as I have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the ≈øame an infinite ≈øort of times in my life, which way ≈øoever the cau≈øe cometh, work thou after this manner, and thou ≈øhalt never ≈øu≈øtain blame or di≈øcredit.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45531:194"/>

This moi≈øture hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the moi≈øture of the Lungs, and untill ≈øuch time as the Lungs be di≈øcharged thereof, the Catarre will continue in his force. This infirmity reigneth more in flegmatick and melancholy bodies, then in any of other con≈øtitutions: Such as are troubled with it are not long lived, becau≈øe their Lungs con≈øume by little and little, and thereupon they are troubled with the <hi>Pti≈øick,</hi> and con≈øequently they peri≈øh if they be not quickly releived. I will now ≈øhew thee a rare ≈øecret to cure the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pulmonaria,</hi> and <hi>Sena,</hi> that is fre≈øh and new, infu≈øe them in wine and water over a ≈ømall or gentle fire, till the wine have drawn out the vertue; then ≈øtrain it, and put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our <hi>Quinte≈ø≈øence,</hi> and keep it clo≈øe in a gla≈ø≈øe, let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient drink thereof every morning ‚Ñ•. iii. luke warm for twenty dayes together; let him eat good nouri≈øhing meats, for they agree well with this di≈øea≈øe: If the Patient be not too farre ≈øpent, you ≈øhall ≈øee your cure performed in ≈øhort time: In the mean while, if the Patient be weak, you ≈øhall give him new laid Eggs, and good white Wine: If the humidity be perceived not to be quite expelled and evacuated, then give him our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> afterward comfort him again with Re≈øtoratives and Cordials to make him ≈øtrong, and no doubt, by the help of God he ≈øhall be cured. This method of curing this infirmity, differeth from the common cour≈øe that Phy≈øitians take, which would cure it with diet, bleeding, and mollifying liniments, and cau≈øing them to ≈øpit, and ≈øuch like, which are meanes rather to augment the Catarre, then to dimini≈øh the ≈øame.</p>

The fat of a man is (as every man knoweth) hot, and penetrative, and mollifying, if you annoint the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, where the ≈øinews be hard, and drawn together, or contracted, therefore it will quickly re≈øolve them.

                     <p>It is mo≈øt profitable again≈øt tho≈øe infirmities that are in the bloud, for it correcteth the malignity of the bloud, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerveth it, as well as the ≈øpirit of Wine.

                     <p>Al≈øo from the liver of a man will be drawn by di≈øtillation, a water and an oyle.

                  <p>IN ≈øacred Scripture (gentle Reader) among others, we find this law, full of Chri≈øtian love and Charity, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt re≈øtore again the wandering or ≈øtraying Oxe, or A≈ø≈øe of thy Neighbours unto him; Deut.</hi> 22.8. By which ≈øaw the eternall God would, as by an evident argument, confirm and e≈øtabli≈øh among≈øt us mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall love and amity: For if in this ≈øort Gods lawes doe command us to take care of the ≈øtraying Cattle of our enemies, how much more then, doe they will us to help the mi≈øerable ca≈øe, and great dangers, of the bodies of our freinds, and to re≈øtore their health? Wherefore, when as I (together with <hi>Theophra≈øtus Paracel≈øus</hi> and other excellent men) under≈øtood the errours of many Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of our time, I began to devi≈øe with my ≈øelf, by what means I might attain to the knowledge of true Phy≈øick, which is derived out of the light of nature, not out of the dark writings of the Heathen. And I judged it to be nece≈ø≈øary to travell, and to goe unto farre places to ≈øeek out learning and knowledge, and not to hope or look for it, ≈øitting at home idlely. I prepared my ≈øelf therefore to my journy, and with long travell and labour have ≈øearched out, and learned tho≈øe things, which for Chri≈øtian love ≈øake I can no longer keep ≈øilent, that I might call back the wandering children into the path of true doctrine; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declared my journy and labours, they al≈øo being excu≈øed and defended, which are laid open unto all manner of ≈ølanders, by tho≈øe which ≈øo greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Heatheni≈øh Phy≈øick, who≈øe deceits in ≈øome part I will indeavour to di≈øclo≈øe; <hi>I</hi> will afterward declare what tho≈øe, that are de≈øirous of true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Phy≈øick, are to look for at my hands, and what Books of true Phy≈øick I have gathered together in ≈øundry places, being moved with compa≈ø≈øion towards tho≈øe that goe a≈øtray, I will communicate and ≈øet forth for their publike profit and commodity.

It is not ≈øufficient for thee, by bringing thy rea≈øons, to prove, that metalline Medicines are not agreeing for mans nature, neither that metals may be ≈øo prepared that they may heal. Why? Thou denie≈øt that which indeed is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and openly ≈øeen with eyes. It is a foul thing to be ignorant in that that every man knoweth, for out of all doubt you have all heard, that mo≈øt dangerous di≈øea≈øes have been cured with metalline tinctures, yea, with ≈øuch as have not been rightly prepared by counterfet <hi>Paracel≈øians,</hi> as with <hi>Vitrum Antimonii,</hi> which doth pluck up ≈øuddenly at once by the roots the impurities of the Fever, although not without great weakening of the powers, yet it healeth; and yet we allow not of ≈øuch perillous cures: and ≈øo likewi≈øe of others.

whom it is more ea≈øie to reprehend, then to follow: and while≈øt every man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øireth to ≈øeem, or to be thought more learned then other, no man will learn of another. I ≈øay, every <hi>Paracel≈øian,</hi> which doth but onely carry coals unto the work, can ≈øhew you by eye three principles of <hi>Theophra≈øtus</hi> Phy≈øick. Have you ta≈øted the mo≈øt ≈øharp Salt, or the mo≈øt ≈øweet Oil, or the Balm, that mo≈øt delicate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour? All tho≈øe being hidden in every thing that is created, you have not once perceived. The metalline ≈øpirits, in whom Phi≈øick doth con≈øi≈øt, by no means can be found out, neither what force they have, or fellow≈øhip with mans nature, but onely by fire, for as fire did fir≈øt ≈øhew, that the ≈ømoak of <hi>Mercury</hi> was poy≈øon to mans nature without any ≈øubtill ≈øpeculation, but thou didde≈øt never handle coals, neither can≈øt draw any ≈øo ≈ømall a Balm out of the Vegetals; therefore being ignorant in metalline Phy≈øick, thou can≈øt not ≈øo much as once gue≈ø≈øe what it is, and therefore doe≈øt judge of things unknown, as the blind man doth of colours: Is it not a great folly to write again≈øt a thing, and not to under≈øtand it well before? Such as are addicted to <hi>Paracel≈øus</hi> doctrine, when they perceive you have no ≈øtronger weapons, then tho≈øe you have hitherto gathered, they will conclude, that you rather confirm and e≈øtabli≈øh <hi>Paracel≈øus</hi> Phy≈øick, then confute it: It is not enough to ≈øay a thing is fal≈øe, except there be more probable and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øhewed: Hereby it appeareth, that yee nouri≈øh a ≈øecret ignorance of naturall things in your ≈øelves.</p>
                  <p>What, are you tho≈øe great Phi≈øitians and excellent Philo≈øophers? How cometh it then to pa≈ø≈øe, that the force of drugs are hidden and unknown unto you? Doe you not in this point come neer unto the Empericks, whom you with great pride and brag of knowledge reject, when as you ≈øay, the Chymi≈øt, be he never ≈øo excellent, is no Phi≈øitian, but he that with judgement and rea≈øon hath learned to make and u≈øe all remedies for di≈øea≈øes; for in tho≈øe points con≈øi≈øteth the cheife≈øt glory and commendation of a Phi≈øitian, and the onely ≈øafety of the ≈øick: How vain is this rea≈øonable Phi≈øitian, which prepareth his Medicines with rea≈øon and not with the hand? He is the very Phi≈øitian that with his own hand purgeth his Medicines from their venome, and being ≈øo prepared, with ≈øharp judgement doth apply them to their proper di≈øea≈øes, that the ≈øeed of the di≈øea≈øe may be pulled up by the roots, and ≈øo mu≈øt the ≈øpeculation and practi≈øe, rea≈øon and the work concur and joyn together, becau≈øe judgement without practi≈øe is barren. Tell me, how cometh it to pa≈ø≈øe that <hi>Mercury</hi> healeth the French Pox, and the filthy ≈øcab? Why doe you command the mi≈øerable ≈øick per≈øons to annoint them≈øelves with Quick-≈øilver, as Shepheards grea≈øe their Sheep? How happeneth it (I ≈øay) that <hi>Mercury</hi> is the ≈øpeciall be≈øt remedy again≈øt the≈øe di≈øea≈øes? Doe you deny that metals doe any thing, yea, and the greate≈øt part of the≈øe cures? Why doe you command ≈øuch as are infected with Lepro≈øie to ≈øwallow Gold? Why doe you boil it in broths with Capons? Why doe you mingle leaf Gold in your Pills and Electuaries? You know that the force of the Lepro≈øie is often delayed, that it breaketh not out into the upper part of the skin, by taking of crude Gold into the ≈øtomack: Then if Gold that is compact and not re≈øolved doe work this effect, what will not the ≈øpirit of Gold work being loo≈øed from his gro≈ø≈øe ≈øub≈øtance.</p>
                  <p>If you will not beleeve <hi>Paracel≈øus,</hi> that the cure of mo≈øt dangerous di≈øea≈øes lieth hidden in metals, at the lea≈øt, credit tho≈øe that lived long before him;

Take Gold twice or thrice purged with <hi>Antimony,</hi> make it into thinne plates, and in a fit ve≈ø≈øell hang the plates that they touch not one another, and let it be burned and calcined in a Furnace duly prepared by the ≈øpace of half a year with a very ≈øtrong fire, untill at the length the plates being taken out and laid open in the air, they doe di≈ø≈øolve, and there flow from it a certain oily humour, red of colour, and of ta≈øt ≈øweeti≈øh.

                  <p>After the great murther and fury of our Countrymen the French men, when I went with D. <hi>Charles of Chambray,</hi> D. of <hi>Pan≈øay</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> travelling through <hi>I≈øtria, Ragu≈øium, Sclavonia, Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Bizantium,</hi> I ince≈ø≈øantly applyed my whole ≈øtudy to under≈øtand and know ≈øome certainty touching the Philo≈øophers ≈øtone, or Chymicall matters; but I could find no true Philo≈øophers, onely fal≈øe Phi≈øitians and Chymi≈øts every where, which had either altogether none, or el≈øe very little knowledge of naturall Arts and preparations; at the length (by Gods good will) I happened upon a very learned man, <hi>Daniel</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Dalmatia:</hi> Unto this mo≈øt excellent man I directed my letters, the which, together with his an≈øwer, a little after ≈øent to me, I will hereafter publi≈øh, wherein you ≈øhall ≈øee many philo≈øophicall points, delectable to be read and under≈øtood.</p>
                  <p>At the length, when I had ≈øufficiently ≈øearched over the Ea≈øt Countries, and could gather no certain point in naturall Science, I determined to take my journey towards <hi>Germany,</hi> with the mo≈øt courteous Prince <hi>Cabaneus Vydam</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> ≈øtill imploying my mind to the earne≈øt ≈øtudy of Chymycall Phy≈øick; and there I under≈øtood, that Kings and Princes were deceived by unskilfull Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øers, which did utter and ≈øell their ≈øophi≈øticate Chymicall Arts, which they had begged and ≈øcratched together out of all corners, with a pompous ≈øhew, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Princes of their money; whereby it cometh to pa≈ø≈øe, that daily a great number of Sophi≈øters, and ≈øophi≈øticators doe daily ri≈øe and ≈øpring up, through which, not onely the mo≈øt commendable Art of Alchymy receiveth great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is oppre≈ø≈øed and adulterate, and the Chymi≈øts them≈øelves made hatefull unto all men, con≈øuming their life, time, and goods, upon vain works and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, but al≈øo there redoundeth mo≈øt great hurt and damage unto the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; for there are many deceivers ≈øo crafty, that with a di≈ø≈øembled experience in the Chymicall Art, and with fained freind≈øhip, and great promi≈øes, they doe craftily learn of others their cunning, which they challenge for their own, e≈øteem of great value, and carry them about to be ≈øold. As upon a time, certain knaves by craft got from me certain written books, and ≈øold them for a great ≈øum of money.

Wherefore, to the end that ≈øuch as be de≈øirous of the Art may have ≈øome pledge from me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they may make this Science more plain, I will ≈øhortly (God willing) ≈øet forth three books of the Philo≈øophers ≈øtone, written by divers Authours, whereof the fir≈øt was drawn out of certain characters by a noble Brittain, wherein all the dark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which cau≈øe the ≈øayings of Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are much and long to be ≈øearched, examined, and thought upon, before thou can≈øt get out the hidden mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of them. If thou in reading Philo≈øophers Books play the Sluggard, then thou can≈øt never bee perfect in preparing thy matters, and therefore I might not by the Authoritie of the laws of Philo≈øophie, interpret all things openly, word for word to thee. Some things are to bee left for Indu≈øtrious wits, wherein to exerci≈øe them≈øelves by ≈øtudying and ≈øearching. Notwith≈øtanding, if thou bee not unthankfull, all the≈øe things ≈øhall be opened and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto thee in my <hi>Galliae portu,</hi> where very many workings hitherto known of few, ≈øhall faithfully be ≈øet forth. In the mean ≈øea≈øon, know thou, that I am not the devi≈øer of the≈øe particular things, for ≈øome of them I had of gift, and ≈øome other for money and reward came to my hands. To thee I give them freely, which u≈øe well.</p>

                           <p>NOt onely in the≈øe our dayes (friend <hi>John</hi>) but al≈øo in the old time among≈øt the learned, this Proverb hath taken place, <hi>That Ignorance is the mother of marvelling:</hi> Who in the≈øe dayes would not marvell to ≈øee men utterly void of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of learning, to be preferred before learned men, and ≈øuch as are mo≈øt skillfull in the Latine and Greek tongues, and tho≈øe are to be imbraced of Kings and Princes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with mo≈øt liberall gifts, and mo≈øt famous and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men expert in all the tongues to be rejected and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? You, which excell in judgement and learning will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, <hi>That every perfect gift cometh down from the Father of light.</hi> Therefore God doth in the≈øe latter daies ≈øtir up the≈øe Ideots and Empericks to ≈øtir up every Phy≈øitian, that he ≈øhould rightly prepare his own Medicines with his own hands, and being ≈øo prepared, with ≈øharp judgement apply them to their proper di≈øea≈øes, that the ≈øeed of the di≈øea≈øe may be pulled up by the Roots, and not to commit it to an unskillfull cook. And therefore of nece≈ø≈øity from hence mu≈øt both the Theorick and the Practi≈øe, the rea≈øon and the work concur and joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becau≈øe judgement without practice is barren. The greate≈øt number of them will an≈øwer, we know not your works and preparations which require ≈øo great and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour, we are now old and Doctors, we will not bee made yonglings, and Schollers again. If this an≈øwer might take place, the Jew, the Pope and the Turk would not change their ≈øuper≈øtitions, which notwith≈øtanding we know to be mo≈øt contrary to the ≈øacred Scripture. But we ≈øufficiently and daily prove by calcining, ≈øubliming, di≈ø≈øolving, purifying, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtilling, congealing and fixing, by this mo≈øt laudable Art of Alchymie, how the pure may be ≈øeparated from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, and the corruptible from the incorruptible, and that which is venemous and deadly, be changed and made whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45531:225"/>
≈øome and good; and as <hi>Paracel≈øus</hi> ≈øaith concerning this Art, we ≈øhall fir≈øt con≈øider that all things are created of God, for he created of nothing ≈øomething, and that ≈øomething is the ≈øeed of all things, and that ≈øeed worketh that effect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ordained and appointed. All things notwith≈øtanding are ≈øo created, that they ≈øhall come unto our hands, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be in our power, but ≈øo as things not perfect, but to be made perfect, as things not fini≈øhed, but to be fini≈øhed. The matter in them truly is perfect, but the middle and la≈øt matters remain to de made perfect. As for example, God created Iron, Earth, and Clay, but not ≈øuch as they ≈øhould bee, for the clay groweth, yet not like a Pot or other earthen Ve≈ø≈øel: So he created Iron lying in a rude Ma≈ø≈øe, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ≈øo rude unto us, therefore we with our labour mu≈øt make thereof ≈øhoos for hor≈øes, ≈øythes, and ≈øpears. Even ≈øo is it in Phy≈øick, for that is al≈øo created of God, but not ≈øo that it ≈øhould be utterly perfect, but as yet hidden under the earth, not purged from his unclean matter, but that which remaineth to be made perfect in it, is committed to the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øt, that is, to the Phy≈øitian to be purged and clean≈øed. For herbs, trees, ≈øtones, and iron, and what≈øoever is ≈øeen with the eyes is no true Medicine, but is rude and impure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as yet the pure part lyeth hid. And therefore Alchymy teacheth to purge the Medicine, to di≈ø≈øolve it, and to ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate things of contrary kinde from things of the ≈øame kinde, otherwi≈øe rotten things would be mingled with rotten, and the corrupt with the corrupt, and ≈øo con≈øpire to one effect; ≈øo that of one di≈øea≈øe many other ≈øhould ≈øpring or ari≈øe. Briefly, every man loveth not that whereof he hath no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding or knowledge, but flieth from it, contemneth it, and thinketh it not meet to be learned. The body onely, careth for that which is outward, but the mind wor≈øhippeth his God. By how much more the knowledge or under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing doth increa≈øe or grow, ≈øo much the more is the love of the ≈øame augmented. For all things con≈øi≈øt in the true nkowledge of them, and out of that ≈øprings all the good fruits that redound to knowledge. Knowledge al≈øo brings faith, for he that knoweth God, beginneth ≈øtraightway
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45531:225"/>
to put his tru≈øt in him. For ≈øuch as every mans faith is, ≈øuch is al≈øo his knowledge.</p>
                           <p>And contrariwi≈øe, he that doth otherwi≈øe work about nature, worketh like a Painter that painteth an Image, in the which is neither life nor ≈øtrength, wherefore tho≈øe which you call Empericks ≈øhall ri≈øe even before your faces, and take in hand and help grievous di≈øea≈øes, the cures whereof are unpo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto you, and you together with your con≈øultations and rea≈øonings ≈øhall be made laughing ≈øtocks. As lately <hi>B.</hi> in <hi>Germanie</hi> it happened of a certain noble and famous woman which was vexed with the pain of the Matrix. Some Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ≈øaid it was the gravell and the ≈øtone, but an Emperick pa≈ø≈øing by, affirmed that it was neither the gravell nor the Stone, wherefore he commanded a Remedy to be prepared for the Matrix, the which being done, ≈øhe was ≈øtraightwayes healed. Oh what a rumour was rai≈øed by and by of him, ≈øtirring up others al≈øo to rumours and tales, ≈øaying, that her husband doth contemn us, that will rather u≈øe the advice and coun≈øell of an Emperick then ours. Yea, and others that ≈øeemed wi≈øer did finally regard him that would every hour u≈øe the help of an Emperick man mo≈øt unlearned. Mark, I pray you (my friend <hi>Aquilla</hi>) how the enemies inflamed with envie go about to oppre≈ø≈øe the truth: But at the la≈øt, will they, nill they, they ≈øhall be inforced to confe≈ø≈øe that that cannot be denied. But you may object unto me, He that ≈øpeaketh all, excludeth nothing. For there be many worthy learned men, Ma≈øters and Profe≈ø≈øors of Phy≈øick, that do not deny or refu≈øe this Art.

                           <p>AMong≈øt all things that were created of God, water was the fir≈øt, whereunto God joyned his proper earth, and of earth, what≈øoever hath e≈ø≈øence or life, hath his originall. Therefore there are two manife≈øt elements, that is, Water, and Earth; in which the two other lye hid, the Fire in the Earth, and the Aire in the Water: and they are ≈øo knit together, that they cannot be ≈øeparated. Two of them are fixed, as the Earth and Fire, two are flying, as Water and Aire. Therefore every element doth participate within other elements. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45531:227"/>
over, in every element are two other elements, one decaying, Putrifying and combu≈øtible, the other eternall and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the heaven: be≈øides, in the≈øe natures lieth hid another nature which is called by the name of ≈øtinking Pheces, which hinder and take away the ≈øtrength of the re≈øt, ≈øo as they have very little force or none, and thereby make the other elements ≈øtinking and ≈øubject to putrefaction. There is al≈øo two kinds of Waters, the one elementall, the other of rain and river<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters; as there is al≈øo two kinds of Earths, one elementall, clear, ≈øhining, and white, the other black, ≈øtinking, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øtible. Like as al≈øo there be two Fires, one elementall and naturall, the other ≈øtinking and combu≈øtible; the like is al≈øo to be ≈øaid of the aire. The ba≈øe things are ≈øo mingled with the re≈øt, that by and by they corrupt all things, ≈øo that nothing can continue long, for they bring death, and weaken all nature be it never ≈øo noble. This is to be under≈øtood of all things both vegetall, animall, and minerall. Therefore it is nece≈ø≈øary by Art to ≈øeparate the elementall nature from the corruptible, that the matter may be brought to a medicinall qualitie. There be three mo≈øt ≈øubtle ≈øpirits in all things, that is, colour, ta≈øte, and ≈ømell, the≈øe fly away invi≈øibly, the Philo≈øophers call them wild ≈øpirits, becau≈øe they are not fixible, yet the indu≈øtry of the Artificer may fix them. They alwaies grow in the bodily ≈øub≈øtance untill they come to perfection and end. The hearb therefore is to be taken when it is fully grown, and take heed that you loo≈øe none of tho≈øe three ≈øpirits, as the ignorant u≈øe to do with their putrifactions and ≈øeparations of elements. For none of tho≈øe ≈øpirits con≈øi≈øteth of the three elementall elements: but God hath adorned elements with tho≈øe three ≈øpirits, and of them the Fire is animall, the Water, aire ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, and no man, but God can ≈øeparate them a≈øunder. But the water of the clouds may be ≈øeparated from them. Al≈øo all the feces may be ≈øeparated from them which are mingled with them, which are the ≈øtinking and corurptible elements, and the four elementall elements may be brought to a chri≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ≈øhining: but the≈øe three elements, Fire, Aire, and Earth, are un≈øeparable. My ≈øon, know this, that <hi>Mercurie</hi> is the fir≈øt of all things, for before time there was water, <hi>And the ≈øpirit of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45531:227"/>
Lord re≈øted upon the water,</hi> but what was that water; the water of the Clouds, or a moi≈øture which might be poured out? No, but it was a dry du≈øtie water, and God hath joyned his earth unto it which is his ≈øulphur, and ≈øo the earth congealeth the water, and thereof ≈øprung the four elements included in the≈øe two, by the will of God. Therefore <hi>Mercurie</hi> congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ≈øulphur, and ≈øulphur <hi>Mercurie;</hi> neither can one of the≈øe be without the other, as al≈øo they cannot be without their ≈øalt, which is the chiefe≈øt meanes, by who≈øe help nature ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and bringeth forth all vegetals, minerals, and animals. Wherefore the≈øe three, <hi>Mercury,</hi> Salt, and Sulphur, cannot be one without another, for where the one is found, there the other are found al≈øo, neither is there any thing in nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the≈øe three are not found: and of the≈øe three, what≈øoever is in nature hath his originall, and are ≈øo mingled with the four elements, that they make one body, and the ≈øalt is drowned in the bottome of the elements, for it is nece≈ø≈øary that the ≈øalt ≈øhould keep them united by his ≈øharpne≈ø≈øe and drine≈ø≈øe, notwith≈øtanding it is a flying ≈øpirit, but becau≈øe it ≈øticketh in the bottome of the mixture, and is overcome of the fatne≈ø≈øe and combu≈øtible oyle, in which it is found: as the yolk within the white of the egg, and the combu≈øtible oyle liveth of earth with the ≈øalt and feces, and the ≈øalt is buried in the bottome of the feces of the combu≈øtible oyle and earth, but by great force of fire. The≈øe three ≈øpirits whereof we have ≈øpoken, are ≈øaid fir≈øt to be ≈øeparated from the mixture of the elements, which is the ≈øoul of all things, or their Quinte≈ø≈øence, which houldeth together the whole mixture of the elements; for when the ≈øpirits are gone out, then the mixture is di≈ø≈øolved by it ≈øelf and divided, neither is there need of fire to expell the ≈øalt from the earth; when the elements are ≈øeparated from the feces, then is the ≈øalt al≈øo ≈øeparated with it. This ≈øalt is unknown to the ignorant. Therefore ≈øalt is the meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the gro≈ø≈øe earthly parts, and the three flying ≈øpirits re≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the naturall heat, that is, the ta≈øte, moi≈øt ≈ømell, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: which three are the life, ≈øoule, and quinte≈ø≈øence of every thing, neither can the≈øe three ≈øpirits be one without the other, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho≈øt are one, yet three
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45531:228"/>
per≈øons, and one is not without the other. The ignorant laugh, neither under≈øtand they the≈øe three ≈øpirits, when as they are tied to the gro≈ø≈øe, earthly fixed parts, and are made ≈øubtile, and their ≈øalt is joyned and mingled with them, it mu≈øt transform them altogether, and fix them into a Cri≈øtaline body, Diaphanes, and red of colour, whereof we will ≈øpeak hereafter; he that knoweth not this ≈øalt, ≈øhall never bring any to pa≈ø≈øe in Art. The Philo≈øophers call this ≈øalt a dry water, and a lively ≈øalt, but the ignorant thought they meant Mercurie, but the Philo≈øophers called the three ≈øpirits Mercurie, and the earth Sulphur, which the ignorant under≈øtand not. Either of them cannot be without the other, neither is there any thing in nature, in which the≈øe three are not, and they are ≈øo mixed with the four elements, that they make one body and mixture. What≈øoever God hath created is in the≈øe three ≈øtones, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all may be reduced into a Cri≈øtalline clearne≈ø≈øe by Art, given by God unto the Philo≈øophers, for in the latter daies God will ≈øeparate all the unclean feces and corruption that is in the elements, and bring them to a Cri≈øtaline clearne≈ø≈øe, and redne≈ø≈øe of a Carbuncle. Afterward there ≈øhall be no more corruption, but they ≈øhall endure for ever. Do you think that all things, which God hath created in the≈øe lower parts, ≈øhould utterly peri≈øh in the latter day? No, not the lea≈øt haire of tho≈øe things which God hath created, no more then the incorruptible Heaven, but God by his Will will change all things, and make them Cri≈øtalline, and the four elements ≈øhall be perfect, ≈øimple, and fixed in them≈øelves, and they ≈øhall be all a quinte≈ø≈øence. Demon≈øtration of the≈øe things may be made here upon earth by Art, for what≈øoever God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may be brought to a Cri≈øtalline clearne≈ø≈øe, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments gathered together into a ≈øimple fixed ≈øub≈øtance, which being done, no man can alter them, neither the fire it ≈øelf burn or change them, but they ≈øhall continue perpetually as tho≈øe things which have attained eternitie.</p>

                           <head>Here beginneth a manuall or handy work, how the Quinte≈ø≈øence may be drawn out of Honey.</head>
                           <p>NOw will I open unto you a great Secret in the Vegetall work of honie, to wit, a marvellous nature, for it is drawn out of the mo≈øt noble and pure part of the floures. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bees is ≈øuch, that they draw out the be≈øt of every thing, as in the Animall work is more at large de≈øcribed, wherein there is taught how to extract the nature of all bea≈øts, and ≈øpeciallly in the 84. Chapter. Wherefore (my ≈øon) know this, that all that God hath created good in the upper part of the world, are perfect and uncorruptible, as the heaven: but what≈øoever in the≈øe lower parts, whether it be in bea≈øts, fi≈øhes, and all manner of ≈øen≈øible creatures, hearbs or plants, it is indued with a double nature, that is to ≈øay, perfect, and unperfect; the perfect nature is called the Quinte≈ø≈øence, the unperfect the Peces or dreggs, on the venemous or combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtible oile. Therefore you ≈øhall ≈øeparate the dregs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øtible oyle, and then that which remaineth is perfect, and is called the Quinte≈ø≈øence, which will endure continually, even as the heaven, neither can it be di≈ø≈øolved with fire or any other thing. For when God had created all things, and looked upon them, they were all perfect good, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lacking to any; and therefore for loves ≈øake I ≈øay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that God hath put a ≈øecret nature or influence in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature, and that to every nature of one ≈øort or kind he hath given one common influence, and to every one of ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall kinds their ≈øeverall influence and vertue, whether it bee on Phy≈øick, or other ≈øecret works, which partly are found out by naturall workman≈øhip. And yet more things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known then are apparant to our ≈øen≈øes: What! doe you not think that an hearb that is appointed for one di≈øea≈øe, which it will cure, doth not contain in it many more vertues then are known unto us? Yes truly many more. This al≈øo I adde, that if the Feces and combu≈øtible oyle be taken away from this thing or hearb, which in all things is the poi≈øon that ≈øhould be taken away, that brings death unto us, and the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45531:231"/>
Elements ≈øhould be purified, and ≈øo burned together by Art, that they ≈øhall pa≈ø≈øe together by a Limbeck, and be joyned together, as it were coupled in marriage, that it may root out all manner of di≈øea≈øe from every thing, be it hearb or living thing, or be drawn from his venome, as in the 14. Chapter of the Prologue of this Book is declared, and al≈øo in the Prologue of the Animall work, whereas the manner of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Quinte≈ø≈øence out of all venemous bea≈øts, birds, worms, and flies, is plainly declared, that it may help all the griefs of man, but that ≈øpecially is drawn out of the bloud of man, and there is likewi≈øe declared, that there is no need of things without man or bea≈øt to help ≈øuch as are infected. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature contains in him≈øelfe the remedy of his di≈øea≈øe, which remedie may be drawn without the hurt of man or bea≈øt, that the di≈øea≈øe may be miraculou≈øly cured, as is there mo≈øt excellently taught in the Theorick and in the Practick. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would write this, that thou ≈øoon mighte≈øt under≈øtand what marvellous force is in Honey, which is taken out of all floures, and gathered into one Ma≈ø≈øe, which truly is indued with ≈øundry Vertues. For if God hath given unto other things the gift of healing, what then is there not in Honey, which is gathered out of ≈øo many floures, and every hearb indued with his own proper Vertue? Truly if it be brought to his height and excellencie, it will work marvellou≈øly. Now con≈øider what lieth hidden in this Quinte≈ø≈øence, and e≈øteem it not lightly, but keep it ≈øecret as the mo≈øt excellent thing of all the Animal work, the which being obtained, you ≈øhall need no other Medicines to put away all the accidents of the bodie.</p>

My ≈øon, know this, that there is no common water in Honey, but onely
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45531:231"/>
Philo≈øophicall and Elementall, for the element of Aire doth fir≈øt pa≈ø≈øe with the element of fire, in the which the aire is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the aire when it ri≈øeth, re≈øembleth the ≈øavour of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> di≈øtilled, and at the fir≈øt can not be known from <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> neither by ≈øight, neither by ≈øavour: di≈øtill it untill there will no more ari≈øe, then leave the ve≈ø≈øell in <hi>Balneo</hi> five daies with a Limbeck and receiver, let it boyl night and day, that the matter may be dried, then let it cool, and take it out, and take away the receiver and Limbeck, and that which is in the receiver pour into the ve≈ø≈øel again upon the dry matter, and ≈øet it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and cover the mouth of the ve≈ø≈øel with a clean di≈øh well luted, and let your <hi>Balneum</hi> be onely luke warm. My ≈øon, under≈øtand that it may thus be done, for it is good that the fire be drawn with his proper aire, ≈øo as a man would ≈øtay ≈øo long, for it would be of the greater force. The ancient Philo≈øophers wrought in this ≈øort, but the danger is, when the ve≈ø≈øels ≈øhall be opened lea≈øt the water fly away, for it is as ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till as wine. For every time the aire is to be drawn away, and againe to be poured on, making putrifaction in a warm <hi>Balneo,</hi> but fir≈øt it mu≈øt be well luted, and a Limbeck being ≈øet on with a receiver, you mu≈øt reiterate the work, untill the fire ri≈øe like unto red bloud.

                              <p>NOw my Son, if thou wilt bring this Quinte≈ø≈øence yet to a greater perfection: Take a great Circulatory, or Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45531:233"/>
that is, a gla≈ø≈øe that hath a great head like to a <hi>Limbeck,</hi> and in the top of the head a hole, by the which the matter may be poured in by a Funnell; let the hole be ≈øtopped; out of the head cometh forth two armes bending round unto the belly, by the which that which doth a≈øcend up may fall down again by tho≈øe armes of gla≈ø≈øe into the belly of the Pellican: This is the form of the Ve≈ø≈øels that di≈øtill one into another, or Pellican. 1. Take then your Quinte≈ø≈øence, and put it in a Pellican in a≈øhes, but better in ≈øalt prepared and dried, and make your fire like unto the extream heat in Summer, and the Quinte≈ø≈øence will ri≈øe like unto a red Oil, and fall down again by the armes of the Pellican; and by often a≈øcen≈øion, the Quinte≈ø≈øence will wax thick, that it will tarry in the bottom and ri≈øe no more; then fortifie the fire that it may a≈øcend and de≈øcend again; then keep the fire in that heat untill it a≈øcend no more, but re≈øt in the bottom; then make your fire ≈øtronger, that it may a≈øcend and de≈øcend again, and keep the heat in the ≈øame degree untill it ri≈øe no more. 2. Ob≈øerve this manner in augmenting your fire untill the water be fixed, and the gla≈ø≈øe be red hot four and twenty houres together; if the Quinte≈ø≈øence doe not then a≈øcend, it is fixed, and brought unto his highe≈øt vertue; and take it out of the gla≈øs, being yet hot, for if it be cold, it will wax hard, ≈øo that you mu≈øt break the gla≈ø≈øe; for at the fire it doth wax liquid, and being ≈øet open in the air, it doth congeal, and peirceth every hard thing, as Oil doth any dry leather, and in colour is like unto a Rubie, and through ≈øhining like a Chri≈øtall, it giveth light in the dark, ≈øufficient to read by. What doe≈øt thou think of this my Son? are there not many ≈øtrange bodies created of God? Truly he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Philo≈øophers with no le≈ø≈øe gifts; for they that can look into the ≈øecrets of nature, ≈øhall ≈øee it to be of an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible operation, for this is gathered by the Bees of the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile≈øt part of all Plants, Trees, Floures, and Fruits, and at that time, when Floures break out and Trees bud. It is worthily called the Philo≈øophers ≈øtone, for it is fixed and liquable as Wax, and as the minerall ≈øtone tran≈ømuteth the impure metall, ≈øo doth this alter di≈øea≈øes. Hereby it doth appear, that this doth bear the bell among≈øt all vegetals; whereas it being yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45531:234"/>
in his gro≈øene≈ø≈øe and impute, it is but of ≈ømall value for any u≈øe in Phy≈øick, by what means ≈øo ever it be boiled or ≈øcummed, but doth alwayes retain his nature; for it con≈øi≈øteth of all the fruits of the earth, plants, and trees: Whereof one hearb is hot, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cold, another dry, another moi≈øt, one a≈øtringent, another laxative, ≈øome corro≈øive, others venomous; and ≈øo divers hearbs have their divers qualities. 3. It cometh to pa≈ø≈øe, if it help one di≈øea≈øe, by and by it hindereth another; for every thing worketh according to his property, when as there is ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made in the body; and of this ≈øeparation it ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth bloud and other humours: And they are likened unto Gunpowder, which ≈øo long as it lieth ≈øtill there cometh no hurt of it, but if it be brought unto the fire, it ≈øtrait uttereth his ≈øecret nature, and is kindled with a venomous fire, which cannot be quenched with water; for the cold and dry, hot and moi≈øt, doe ≈øtrive among≈øt them≈øelves, a wind is ≈øtirred up, that breaketh all things that is near unto it. The like happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto Honey, that when it cometh to the region of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that it ≈øhould be there ≈øeparated, then it ≈øheweth his nature to pa≈ø≈øe up, and ≈øwell with wind, that it is no marvell, if that through contention the veins of the Liver be broken, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happeneth, whereupon Impo≈øthumes are cau≈øed in divers places, and bringeth forth ≈øuch inflammations, that the veines are ea≈øily broken; although many doe greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Honey, but they are not the children of Philo≈øophy, neither doe they under≈øtand the nature of it: But when it is brought to a ≈øimple, fixed as Wine, then is it the cheife≈øt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine among≈øt all the vegetables, neither is the like unto this found in all the world. Give God thanks, and be liberall unto the poor. The do≈øe of this is one grain, and it mu≈øt be taken every morning with an empty ≈øtomack, likewi≈øe in the evening, untill the end of the di≈øea≈øe. For every di≈øea≈øe will be cured in ≈øhort time, even after the ≈øame manner, as the Minerall ≈øtone maketh his projection upon metals: Prai≈øe God, and labour diligently.</p>

                           <head>The manner and order how to draw the Quinte≈ø≈øence out of the Hearb, called <hi>Ro≈øe ≈øolis.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>NOw my Son, I will teach thee the greate≈øt my≈øtery or ≈øecret among≈øt all vegetable things, who≈øe force and ≈øtrength hath been kept ≈øecret among≈øt all the antient work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and they have bound them≈øelves one to another by Oath, that they ≈øhould not utter, in their books or writings, the ≈øtrength of this Hearb, which is called <hi>Ro≈øe ≈øolis,</hi> and in the Germane tongue <hi>Sindawe.</hi> Who≈øoever therefore hath not the whole vegetable work, he cannot attain to the ≈øtrength of this Hearb; for in that work is comprehended all the force of medicinall things: And this work of vegetables is not come to the hands, but onely of the antient ≈øworn Artificers, which were skilfull in the liberall Arts. But now my Son, I will open it unto thee with adjuration, that thou ≈øhalt keep this hidden knowledge ≈øecret. Fir≈øt, my Son, you mu≈øt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, that this Hearb is the Hearb of the Sun, upon the which the Sun ≈øpreads his beames and influences, as he doth upon Gold in the veines of the Mines; and he poureth out his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences more upon this Hearb, then upon any other which is created of God, as it is evidently known of the antient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers, and this Hearb doth ≈øo farre ≈øurmount all other Hearbs which ≈øpring out of the earth, as the Sun doth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Planets in the Heaven, and hath greater force and power of influence then any other thing created of God in the Firmament. So this hearb doth excell all others in vertue, and therefore this hearb is decked with another colour, other leaves, and ≈øtranger ≈øhape then all other hearbs. And his nature is ≈øuch, that the hotter and drier the country is in the time of the year, and the heat of the Sun, and the more that the Sun doth heat and burn him, this hearb is the more moi≈øt and filled with dew, in≈øomuch, that upon one branch will hang above a thou≈øand drops. Make a triall, and ≈øtrike this hearb with a ≈ølender twig, that the drops which fall from it may fall into a large gla≈ø≈øe ve≈ø≈øell, and you ≈øhall ≈øee the ve≈ø≈øell filled with a marvellous dew, and if the Sun be vehement hot, tho≈øe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45531:235"/>
branches in ≈øhort ≈øpace, that is, within the ≈øpace of half an hour will be more full of dew then before, and if you ≈øtrike the dew twentie times with a rod, yet it will again bee laden with drops; it were enough if wee did ≈øee no other miracle then from whence this dewie humour ≈øhould ri≈øe, which in ≈øo ≈øhort ≈øpace doth ≈øo abundantly flow from it, and how much the more the burning ≈øun doth ≈øcorch up the other hearbs, ≈øo much the more is this moi≈øt, and filled with drops, even as though it had been ≈øprinkled over with water, hereupon may we gather his marvellous qualities, and judge that there is ≈øome ≈øecret operation hidden in it; if thou do keep this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thus gathered in a gla≈ø≈øe, therewith thou ≈øhalt cure all the di≈øea≈øes of the eyes, whether they come of Rheums, or of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation: It helpeth moreover all the pains and di≈øea≈øes of the heart, it cooleth the Liver, and ≈øtomack that is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and doth mitigate all the pain of the head that cometh of heat, and driveth away all dreams and Phanta≈øies: It is good al≈øo to kill the Canker and the Wolf, again≈øt the biting of Venemous bea≈øts, again≈øt Poi≈øon drunke, if it be taken by the mouth, it helpeth al≈øo the Pe≈øtilence, it is good for many other di≈øea≈øes which were too long here to rehear≈øe.</p>
                           <p>This hearb hath the colour of the ≈øun, for his colour is red dark, divided with yellow lines, and his ≈øhape is like a Star, and his proportion like a heavenly Planet, and con≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of ≈øeven branches, in the outward part broad, neer the ground narrow, and it is as though it were heavie, of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øub≈øtance, outwardly hot and moi≈øt, inwardly cold and dry. The left ≈øide of it is cold and moi≈øt, the right ≈øide hot and dry, and it is mo≈øt temperate as gold. Wherefore his Elements cannot be ≈øeparated one from another as in other hearbs, but it may be purged from his Feces, for his fixing letteth that the Elements cannot be ≈øeparated, for the fire will a≈øcend with the aire by the <hi>Balneum,</hi> as we will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teach. The earth may be ≈øeparated from his Feces, and the Feces likewi≈øe from the fire and aire, although it hath not many dregs. Some Latine Writers call it <hi>Lingua avis,</hi> or Birds-tongue; ≈øome call it <hi>Solaria</hi> of the Sun, of <hi>Lunaria</hi> it is called the Moon; the Fleming calls it <hi>Sindow.</hi> But the old
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45531:235"/>
Philo≈øophers have kept ≈øecret the qualities as yet for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous effect it worketh. And it is marvell, ≈øaith <hi>Arnoldus de Villa nova</hi> that a man ≈øhould die that eateth every day ≈øome of it in his gro≈ø≈øe ≈øub≈øtance, what will it then work when it is brought unto his finene≈ø≈øe, and clean≈øed from his Feces? It hath this great vertue in it, that if it be put into a gla≈ø≈øe, wherein there is poi≈øon mingled with wine, or any other cup that is poi≈øoned, ≈øtraightwayes the gla≈ø≈øe will flie in Pieces, but if it be a ≈øtone pot of Alaba≈øter, or ≈øuch like, the Wine will ≈øo boil, as though there were a violent fire under it, and all the wine will run out untill there be nothing left in the ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel: Al≈øo if any man carrie this hearb about him, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen on his enemies, they ≈øhall have no power to hurt, but contrariwi≈øe to ≈øhew him all kind of dutie. Al≈øo if any man bee bewitched either in bodie, or in his art, that is in Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie, Brewing, or Baking, or by any other meanes, this hearb carried about him makes him free from the witchcraft. If it be al≈øo tyed upon the belly of a woman with child, ≈øhe ≈øhall ≈øtraightwayes be delivered, although the childe were dead and rotten within, as it hath been oftentimes proved by experience. This hearb carried about one, or a little there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of every day eaten as long as it is u≈øed, pre≈øerveth a man from the Falling Sickne≈ø≈øe. Moreover, if a man be taken with the Apoplexie, that his mouth be drawn a≈øide, and his ≈øpeech and ≈øen≈øes taken from him, they ≈øhall be all re≈øtored again, if the ≈øick drinke the juyce of this hearb ≈øtreined, as hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes proved. Moreover if it be hanged about the neck of one that is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of a ≈øpirit, ≈øo long as he carrieth that about him, he ≈øhall be quiet as a Lamb, and the power of the ≈øpirit ≈øhall be taken away. Make a proof, and you ≈øhall find it true. The bleeding at the no≈øe is by and by ≈øtayed, if you hold that hearb in your mouth. They that are wearied with travell, if they drink the juyce thereof in wine, they are by and by ≈øo refre≈øhed, as if they had not laboured or gone no journey, it doth comfort the Sinews, Mu≈øcles, Tendons, and all the whole nature. Wounds are al≈øo cured therewith, if it be drunk ten daies together in Wine or Ale, if the wound be wa≈øhed with the ≈øame drinke, and bound up with a cloth wet in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45531:236"/>
≈øame. The pain of the teeth, is by and by appea≈øed, if that hearb be laid unto it. All the≈øe things have been often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and found true. If it will doe ≈øuch things while≈øt it is yet hindred with his gro≈ø≈øe matter, what will it work when it is brought to his perfection? My Son, know this for a truth that there is no hearb that grows upon the earth to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto this in ≈øtrength and goodne≈ø≈øe, therefore take heed that you doe not neglect it, but diligently remember and keep the ≈øecret clo≈øe from them that are not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our children, and from the ignorant. For if this hearb did not grow ≈øo plentifully, and the properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were known, it would be more e≈øteemed then gold or precious ≈øtones, for the Effects of the Quinte≈ø≈øence are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, as hereafter ≈øhall appear.</p>
                           <p>Now there remaineth that we mu≈øt teach how to bring this hearb to his highe≈øt degree, and to his Quinte≈ø≈øence. Fir≈øt, it is to be gathered, the ≈øame having his cour≈øe in his own hou≈øe, that is in the Lion, and the Moon behold him with a ≈øini≈øter quadrate A≈øpect. It is to be gathered whole, with roots, leaves and floures, ≈øo that there be neither earth, dirt, nor other hearbs mingled withall. Neither mu≈øt it by amy means touch any water or be made moi≈øt. Therefore you mu≈øt take heed that you gather it not in rainie weather, or moi≈øt weather: but rather when the Sun doth ≈øhine hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt upon it, gather great ≈øtore of it, and ≈øtamp it well in a morter of Marble, and put it in a <hi>Cucurbite</hi> of ≈øtone with a head and receiver luted, and ≈øet it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and di≈øtil away all the water, untill it be ≈øo dry like pouder, and there will ri≈øe together with the water of the colour of mo≈øt fine gold, which onely happeneth in this hearb, and in none other, and when there remaineth no more liquor, yet leave the cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite for three or four dayes in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and boil it night and day that all the moi≈øture may be perfectly ≈øeparated and drawn away, then let it cool, and take away the receiver, and ≈øtop it diligently, then take off the head, and take out the matter and beat it in a Marble morter into mo≈øt fine powder that it may pa≈ø≈øe through a thick ≈øieve, put this pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again into an earthen cucurbite, and pour on your water
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45531:236"/>
and aire, and ≈øtir it with a woodden ladle, and cover the mouth of the cucurbite clo≈øe with a tile, and ≈øet it in a warm bath by the ≈øpace of nine dayes to putrifie, every day ≈øtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with a wodden ladle four or five times, and cover the cucurbite again with a tile, ≈øetting a weight of lead upon it, at the nine dayes end take your ve≈ø≈øel out of the <hi>Balneo,</hi> and that which is in it, ≈øtrein it into an earthen ve≈ø≈øell gla≈øed, and ≈øtrein it hard untill the matter drie. Then take this dry pouder, and put it into his cucurbite, and cover it with a tile, and keep it in a warm place untill I teach you what you ≈øhall doe with it.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The moi≈øt liquor which is drawn from it will be red, for the Element of fire is there pre≈øent with the air and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, put that liquor into a cucurbite of ≈øtone, and put on a head, and lute it well, and ≈øet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> with a Receiver well luted, and di≈øtill away all the water, with the air ≈øeverally from the fire in a boyling bath, until there will no more di≈øtil, and the fire will pa≈ø≈øe away in the bottome, then take away the ve≈ø≈øel out of the bath and ≈øtop it well untill I teach thee what is further to be done.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Then take again the ≈øtone cucurbite wherein your pouder is contained, which I bad you before to keep, and pour on the fire and the aire, and ≈øtir it well with a wooden ladle, and ≈øet it in a warm bath nine dayes more, and cover it with a tile, and ≈øtir it four or five times every day with a ladle as you did afore. And when the nine daies are pa≈øt, ≈øtrein out that which is in the Ve≈ø≈øel, and pour the liquor into a gla≈øed ve≈ø≈øel, the re≈øidue of the pouder put into another ve≈ø≈øel, as you did before, and keep it ≈øo long untill I teach thee how to draw out the combu≈øtible oyle.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Then take again the Ve≈ø≈øel wherein your fire is, and mingle your liquor with it which you keep in your gla≈øed ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, where your fire and aire is, and ≈øet a head upon the ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel where your matter is, and lute it, and ≈øet it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and ≈øet a receiver to the bill of the head, then di≈øtill out the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and air with a boyling bath until no more will di≈øtill, and you ≈øhall have in the receiver water and aire, take them away, and take the Ve≈ø≈øel out of <hi>Balneo,</hi> and you ≈øhall find remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bottome like thick Turpentine, and that is the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45531:237"/>
of fire mingled with many Feces. Now the fire is to be ≈øeparated from the Feces in this manner, pour on your wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and aire upon that from whence you draw it, and ≈øtir it with a ≈øpoon, and cover it with a tile, and let it ≈øettle four dayes, and the Feces will fall into the bottome, and pour out ≈øoftly that that is clear into a clean cucurbite, that no Feces pa≈ø≈øe; withall ≈øtop the Ve≈ø≈øel wherein the Feces are, and ≈øet it by. But that Ve≈ø≈øel that containeth the water fire, and aire, ≈øet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> with a head and receiver fitted and well luted, and di≈øtill the water and aire in that ≈øame degree. And when it will di≈øtill no more, take away the receiver: Let the ve≈ø≈øel cool, and you ≈øhall find in the bottome your fire, which keep in his ve≈ø≈øel well ≈øtopped, and pour in your water and aire again upon the Feces, from whence you did draw them, and ≈øtir them with a ≈øpoon, and let it ≈øettle four dayes, then pour it out ≈øoftly from his Feces into the ve≈ø≈øell that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your fire, ≈øo that no Feces be mingled withall, cover your ve≈ø≈øell wherein your Feces remain, and ≈øet it up. But your Ve≈ø≈øel, wherein your water, air, and fire, is ≈øet again in <hi>Balneo</hi> as I ≈øhewed you, and di≈øtill away the water and aire, for they two doe alwaies pa≈ø≈øe away together, and the fire remaineth in the bottome. Pour on the water and air again upon the Feces, and ≈øtir it with a ≈øpoon, then let it ≈øettle four dayes, (this is now the third repetition, whereby you have ≈øeparated the water and aire from the Feces,) and that which is clear pour out into the Ve≈ø≈øel that holdeth your fire. Then put your Feces unto the fir≈øt which I bad you keep, in the which your combu≈øtible oyle is. For now you have drawn your fire out of your Feces: therefore di≈øtill your water with the air, and when it will di≈øtill no more, take away your Ve≈ø≈øell, and you ≈øhall finde in the bottome the Element of fire not yet pure, but foul and full of dregs, pour on therefore the water and air again, and ≈øtir it well with a ≈øpoon or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, cover it, and let it ≈øtand, and ≈øettle four dayes, then pour out that which is clear into another clean ve≈ø≈øel, and ≈øet a≈øide the Ve≈ø≈øel wherein your Feces are. But the Ve≈ø≈øel wherein your fire, water, and oyle are, ≈øet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> to di≈øtill as long as it will di≈øtil, then take it out, and pour the liquor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtilled
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45531:237"/>
into the ve≈ø≈øell where your feces are, and doe as I taught you to work with the feces, untill you have your element of fire without any feculent or gro≈ø≈øe ≈øub≈øtance.</p>
                           <p>When you have di≈øtilled away the water and air from the fire, and ≈øuffered it to ≈øettle four dayes, and that all be clear without any feces, then ≈øhall you have your pure fire. Therefore put all your feces together unto your fir≈øt feces, where your combu≈øtbile oyle is. Afterward take a great Cucurbite of gla≈ø≈øe, and put all your three Elements into it, and ≈øet it in a≈øhes with a Limbeck and a Receiver fitted and luted, and kindle a gentle fire, fir≈øt in your furnace, and increa≈øe it more and more, untill the fire and air be pa≈ø≈øed, and that your Limbeck begin to wax red within. Then make the heat of your fire moderate, untill all your element of fire be pa≈ø≈øed, and the head red like bloud, and the water and air ≈øhall ≈øwim upon it like oyle: by this meanes the≈øe three Elements ≈øhall be brought to their highe≈øt e≈ø≈øence, and be perfectly rectified. Take away the Receiver, and ≈øtop it diligently, untill your earth be prepared, and know, that in the du≈øt and feces there remaineth yet a combu≈øtible oyle, which you may extract by a di≈øcen≈øory, if you will. It is good again≈øt the cold Gout, for Members benom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and Sinews too much mollified. If thou be weary of this labour, put this powder or feces into a reverberatory, that they may be mingled with a gentle fire, untill it be as white as ≈ønow; which being done, put it into a large cucurbite of ≈øtone, and pour on a great quantity of water twice di≈øtilled, it is not materiall how much water you pour on, and ≈øtir it well with a woodden ladle or ≈øpoon five or ≈øix times, alwayes cover it diligently with a tile, and after four dayes ≈øuffer it to cool, and let it ≈øtand four dayes and ≈øettle, then pour out the cleer from the feces warily into another clean ve≈ø≈øell, and pour on fre≈øh di≈øtilled water as before, ≈øtir it with your ≈øpoon, and keep it two dayes in <hi>Balneo</hi> as before, then ≈øuffer it to cool and ≈øettle, and pour out the clear from the feces, and put it to the fir≈øt water; doe this the third time, and then ca≈øt away the feces, for they are good for nothing: All your waters that you have drawn, di≈øtill by <hi>Balneo,</hi> or, for the more ≈øpeed, by a≈øhes, that all the water may ri≈øe, and that there remain in the bottome a du≈øty matter, pour on di≈øtilled water again, ≈øtir it, and keep it in <hi>Balneo</hi> by the ≈øpace of four and twenty houres,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45531:238"/>
then let it cool and ≈øettle, and pour out that which is clear gently from the feces: Poure on again more common water upon them, and ≈øtir it, ≈øet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> ten or twelve houres, take it out, let it ≈øettle, and poure the clear unto the fir≈øt water, and ca≈øt away the feces, they are nothing worth. Repeat this work ≈øo often, untill there remain no feces after it hath ≈øetled. Then ≈øhall you have your earth rectified from all his feces, which you ≈øhall congeal and dry, that it may be like powder or du≈øt: Then joyn that with your other elements in the gla≈ø≈øe, and it will ≈øtraight re≈øolve into his element, for the element of water is there pre≈øent: ≈øet them all together in a furnace upon a≈øhes, put on a Head with a Receiver well luted; the head mu≈øt have a hole in the top, that with a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell the liquour may be poured in, and alwayes ≈øtopped ≈øafely. Make your fire in your furnace fir≈øt gentle, afterward greater, untill that, that is fermented, doe pa≈ø≈øe; but all is not to be drawn out, but about half a ≈øextary of the liquour with the water, that the matter may remain moi≈øt; for if you ≈øhould drive out all, it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geale into an hard ma≈ø≈øe, and break the gla≈ø≈øe in the furnace. Then open the hole which is in the top of the Head, and with a funnell poure in that which is in the Receiver; but fir≈øt it mu≈øt be made warm, lea≈øt by pouring in the cold liquour the gla≈ø≈øe doe break, but if you ≈øuffer the gla≈ø≈øe to cool, you may poure it in without any danger. Repeat this inbibition ten or twelve times, afterward di≈øtill out what≈øoever will be di≈øtilled, ≈øo long as any thing will pa≈ø≈øe by the neck of the Limbeck: For after this tenth di≈øtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the earth will be no more congealed, but will re≈øt in the bottome like a red golden Oil. Inbibe it again, pouring on the liquour, and di≈øtilling it untill all the elements pa≈ø≈øe together by the Limbeck, and that nothing at all doe remain in the bottome of the ve≈ø≈øell. Then give thanks to God for his marvellous gifts, which he hath di≈øtributed unto his Philo≈øophers, and hath given them ≈øo great knowledge of things as they uttered in this work, which is altogether heavenly, and rather divine then humane: For it is a great marvell in this life, that mans under≈øtanding can bring the≈øe inferiour things to ≈øo great perfection that they have attained, even to the highe≈øt degree of vertue. Truly it is the work of the Holy Gho≈øt, which hath put it into the mindes of men. For I doe affirm, that who≈øoever hath this hearb ≈øo prepared, that he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45531:238"/>
may help all the infirmities of mans body, whether they be curable or uncurable, except naturall death, which is ordained before unto every man of God. Yea, this I dare be bold to ≈øay, that if a man doe u≈øe daily the weight of one ≈øcruple of this Quinte≈ø≈øence, or the Quinte≈ø≈øence of Sugar, and potable Gold, wherein Pearles are di≈ø≈øolved, or the Quinte≈ø≈øence of Selan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, that man by Gods help ≈øhall not die before the day of the great judgement; for the humours in mans body can by no meanes predominate one over another, as in the thirty ≈øix Chapter of Vegetals is taught, where is treated of the Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈ø≈øence of all Medicinall things, and there it is ≈øhewed, that by Gods help the life of man may be prolonged even untill that day, void and free from all di≈øea≈øes and ≈øickne≈ø≈øe. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that man may be pre≈øerved in the ≈øtate he was in at thirty yeares of age, and in the ≈øame ≈øtrength and force of wit; and upon that doe all the Philo≈øophers agree, that a man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ≈øame ≈øtate as long as in an earthly Paradi≈øe. This is ≈øo plainly and at large ≈øhewed in that Chapter, that will you, nill you, you ≈øhall be inforced to conceive it in your mind to beleeve it, and to confe≈ø≈øe it to be true: Therefore it is not needfull to rea≈øon much of the force and qualities of this Quinte≈ø≈øence, but what≈øoever di≈øea≈øe a man be infected withall, give him to drink with Wine ≈øo much of this Quinte≈ø≈øence as a nut≈øhell will hold, and in ≈øhort ≈øpace he ≈øhall be healed, as it were miraculou≈øly, according as the di≈øea≈øe is, violent or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. But if you give this Quinte≈ø≈øence to drink, mixed with the Quinte≈ø≈øence of Sugar, with potable Gold, wherein Pearles are di≈ø≈øolved, and with the Quinte≈ø≈øence of Selandine, within one day you ≈øhall cure all the di≈øea≈øes what≈øoever they be; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doth appear, that it is rather a divine work then humane. Therefore give God the prai≈øe, and take heed that you doe not utter this ≈øecret, for Tyrants would by that means prolong their lives, that they might bring to pa≈ø≈øe their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes, whereof both you and I ≈øhould be the occa≈øion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep it ≈øecret, for it is one of the greate≈øt ≈øecrets among≈øt all the vegetals, whereunto no trea≈øure may be compared. Work therefore, and di≈øtribute liberally unto the poor, and God ≈øhall give thee eternall felicity.</p>

                           <p>IT is an old and true ≈øaying of the Poet, that there is nothing more imperious than an ignorant man, which thinketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well done, but that he doth him≈øelf, which thing, as it may be ≈øeen in many other Arts, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> mo≈øt e≈øpecially in this, which is called the Spagyrick Art. For we ≈øee every where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men, I know not what they be, puffed up with a certain barbarous and fooli≈øh pride, which with great ≈øcorne inveigh again≈øt tho≈øe Medicines which are drawn out of the metalline Mines: which notwith≈øtanding it is apparent were in u≈øe, and had in great e≈øtimation with the cheif antient Phi≈øitians, as we have declared in that book, which we have ≈øet forth of the Spagyrick preparation of Medicines. And what, I pray you, is the cau≈øe of this anger, or rather madne≈ø≈øe, but that (as they them≈øelves confe≈ø≈øe) they know not the preparation of them? O happy Arts, if onely Artificers might judge of them, as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> is reported ≈øometimes to have ≈øaid: Then are they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, of whom the ignorant and unlearned fear not ≈øo ra≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give judgement, which never yet under≈øtood from whence, or why, this is called the Spagyrick Art, which learned men of two greek words have ≈øo named; becau≈øe by that Art a certain ≈øubtill and ≈øpirituall nature is drawn, gathered, and pre≈ø≈øed out, wherein the force and effect of the Medicine doth cheifly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt; the great and incomparable commodity whereof, as it appeareth in many other di≈øea≈øes, ≈øo ≈øhall it cheifly be known in curing wounds by gun-≈øhot: As I tru≈øt (God willing) it ≈øhall much more happily be tried and found out, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of Medicines animall, vegetable, and minerall, and by other E≈ø≈øences drawn out of Mercury, Sulphur, Vitriol, Ar≈øenick, Iron, Copper, Lead, and Litarge, and al≈øo out of Antimony, and ≈øuch other minerals, as al≈øo out of the gro≈ø≈øe and fat bodies of ≈øimple metals, of whom it is farre off, that the force ≈øhould be ≈øo great (although the antient Phi≈øitians have u≈øed them to cure Wounds and Ulcers, as their Writings
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45531:239"/>
doe te≈øtifie) as the force of their ≈øpirits, which may be called, as it were, their ≈øoules. But peradventure ≈øome of tho≈øe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters will ≈øay, why are not we content with tho≈øe Medicines and Remedies, which the learned Antiquity hath delivered unto us, and that <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Gallen,</hi> the antient Pillars of our Art, and others, have ≈øet forth in their Monuments? why ≈øeek we new wayes never heard of before, e≈øpecially unknown to the Apothecaries? But ≈øome of us will an≈øwer, that the onely remedy of <hi>Mercury</hi> precipitate, is the onely remedy (to pa≈ø≈øe over other) which very lately they have begun to u≈øe in curing of Wounds by gun-≈øhot, and other maligne Ulcers, were ≈øufficient to an≈øwer this their que≈øtion, yea, and to reprove their folly joyned with intollerable pride. But if authority be asked for, I think <hi>Ge≈øner, Guinter, Andernack, Severine,</hi> (to pa≈ø≈øe over a great many other) will be for us of great authority with the learned, as the≈øe ≈ølanderers; e≈øpecially, becau≈øe the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the≈øe famous men is confirmed by their learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Monuments, that tho≈øe tongues might count it a great honour unto them, to confe≈ø≈øe them≈øelves their Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. It were ea≈øie for me to bring forth many other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if I did not ≈øee the folly of the≈øe back-biters to be ≈øo great, whereof truly I am a≈øhamed, e≈øpecially when I behold ≈øome of their books lately ≈øet forth, wherein, contrary to the purpo≈øe of the Treati≈øe, ≈øtrange things are inforced, that (as the old Proverb ≈øaith) the ointment ≈øeemeth to con≈øi≈øt in nothing, as though they pertain to the purpo≈øed treating of curing the Gout, certain invective digre≈ø≈øions I know not what of the beginning of things, of the originall of metals and Philo≈øophers ≈øtone (which of them is called <hi>Moro≈øophocus</hi>) or did in any point ≈øeem to agree with it. Therefore again and again I am inforced to cry out, O happy Arts, if onely Artificers might judge of them. How farre unlike was the purpo≈øe of many old men, the which if they were ignorant of any thing, which they under≈øtood was known of others, even in farre di≈øtant Countries, they ≈øpared no labour to goe ≈øee them. <hi>Plato</hi> inflamed with de≈øire to learn tho≈øe things which he knew not, went into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and after to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitas,</hi> and over all <hi>Italy,</hi> to hear the other Pythagorical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45531:240"/>
                              <hi>Apollonius Tyanius</hi> travelled through the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> and pa≈ø≈øed over the Mountain <hi>Cauca≈øus,</hi> and vi≈øited the <hi>Albanes, Scythians, Ma≈ø≈øagets,</hi> and all the rich king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>India;</hi> afterwards was carried unto the <hi>Brachmanes,</hi> and heard <hi>Jarehas</hi> in his chaire of gold di≈øputing of the hidden cau≈øes of things, and of the hidden my≈øteries of nature; from thence by the <hi>Elamites, Babylonians, Chaldees, Medes, A≈ø≈øiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Pale≈øtines,</hi> he returned to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and from thence went into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to hear the <hi>Gymno≈øophi≈øts,</hi> and to learn their ≈øecret and hidden Arts. This vertue is truly to be followed, and not the ≈øluggi≈øhne≈ø≈øe of tho≈øe ≈ølouthful fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, which having ≈øcarce once moved their foot from their country fires, yet will di≈øallow this Spagerick Art, and think no further labour to be taken in ≈øearching of the truth, when notwith≈øtanding, that Art doth make open unto us the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous and hidden ≈øecrets of nature; neither in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are they unworthily contemned of tho≈øe, which with their manifold perils and travels have ≈øought out tho≈øe ≈øecrets of nature. But, I pray you, what fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe is this, to forbid us to u≈øe any other Medicines, then tho≈øe which were known in old time? As though Rhabarbe, then which no Medicine is more in u≈øe this day, then were known to the old Phi≈øitians: Further, to what purpo≈øe is it, that they object unto us the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phury metalline venomous ≈øtinks (as they call them) by who≈øe ≈ømell and drawn breath (for the≈øe are their contumelious words) they be almo≈øt ≈øtrangled that come into the dens of tho≈øe <hi>Cyclops?</hi> But is it unknown unto tho≈øe ≈ølanderers and Sycophants, that the old Phi≈øitians made very many Medicines of mo≈øt filthy things, as of the filth of the eares, ≈øweat of the body, of womens men≈øtrues (and that which is horrible to be ≈øpoken) of the dung of man and other bea≈øts, Spittle, Urine, Flies, Mice, the a≈øhes of an Owles head, the hoves of Goats and A≈ø≈øes, the Wormes of a rotten tree, and the ≈øcurfe of Mules, as may be gathered out of the Writings of <hi>Galen, A√´tius, Aegineta, Dio≈øcor. Marcel. Plin. Serap.</hi> to pa≈ø≈øe the metallines, which it is evident they did al≈øo u≈øe. Truly, when I con≈øider with my ≈øelf the pride of the≈øe fooles, which di≈ødain this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline part of Phy≈øick, which after their manner contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liou≈øly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45531:240"/>
they call <hi>Chymericam,</hi> and therefore can neither help their own, nor many other di≈øea≈øes. I call to minde a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, peradventure known unto them of <hi>Herachto Ephe≈øio,</hi> which being ≈øick of a drop≈øie, de≈øpi≈øing the help of Phy≈øitians, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing him≈øelf over with cow-dung, ≈øet him≈øelf in the Sun to drie, and falling a≈øleep was torn in pieces of dogs: but the≈øe are more then ≈øufficiently an≈øwered unto the≈øe fools and ≈ølanderers.</p>
                           <p>Now I will declare what is my purpo≈øe and ≈øcope in the Treati≈øe; verily to pre≈øcribe plainly hereafter, not tho≈øe things which are already common, or (as it is commonly ≈øaid) known to blind men and Barbers, le≈øt I might ≈øeem to imitate tho≈øe that u≈øe to write <hi>Rhap≈øodias,</hi> and heaps, but the method and way of preparing Medicines by Spagerick art, that pertain unto Gun≈øhot, which I know are yet unknown unto many Phy≈øitians and Chirurgians. And this I can truly confe≈ø≈øe, that I am induced for two cau≈øes to doe it: Fir≈øt, to provoke tho≈øe that are better learned, if they have any better Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to utter them, as al≈øo that I might ≈øpecially help my countrie and mankinde: unto the which (the more is the grief) there is too much need of tho≈øe kinde of Medicines in the≈øe mo≈øt lamentable and cruell times, wherein it hath ≈øo long been bloudded with dome≈øtical and civil wars; but to incounter with their ≈ølanders which cry out, that the≈øe kind of Medicines doe not onely require long and difficile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, but al≈øo that they are ≈øo dear that every one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ea≈øily u≈øe them. I have thought good therefore fir≈øt to ≈øet down common Medicines, and then to come to tho≈øe which I doe far more e≈øteem, as indeed they are far more excellent then the other, as by their preparation you may know. Albeit al≈øo I have determined to have con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the poor and common Souldier, and to ≈øet down them apart that ≈øhall help the rich.</p>
                           <p>Therefore the Chirurgians are to be admoni≈øhed, that when they goe into the warres, that they take with them the≈øe things ready prepared, which are to be had at mo≈øt Apothecaries.</p>

                           <p>Although ≈øometimes I have met with women, which have ≈øo much abounded with bloud, that unle≈ø≈øe they had been let bloud in the ≈øecond moneth, they would have aborted in the third; others again, unle≈ø≈øe they ≈øhould attempt the ≈øame in the ≈øeventh or eight moneth, they could not carry their great belly ≈øo long, or el≈øe would be delivered of a dead i≈ø≈øue.</p>

                           <p>VVHen now the pangs of child-bearing women increa≈øe more and more, let the Midwife inwardly annoint the ≈øecret or natural parts with oyle of Cammomil, and white Lillies, nor let her ≈øet the woman in the ≈øeat, before ≈øhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the womb to be loo≈øed and re≈øolved, and the humours to flow over more plentifully.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, ≈øhe may not bring her to labour and ≈øtrugling, before the birth ≈øhew it ≈øelf to her view; for they doe but labour in vain, and doe violently di≈øtort and wre≈øt away the ≈øtrength of the labouring woman, that afterward,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45531:265"/>
when ≈øhe ≈øhall have need, it will not be able to work it forth.</p>
                           <p>But ≈øhe ≈øhall ≈øit fitly over again≈øt the woman in labour, and ≈øhall diligently ob≈øerve on what part the birth moveth it ≈øelf; for if it come the right way, ≈øhe ≈øhall annoint and cheri≈øh the ≈øecret parts with odoriferous Oils; and if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to the ≈øides, ≈øhe ≈øhall with both hands govern and di≈øpo≈øe the belly, that it may fall to the mouth of the womb.</p>
                           <p>And if the hand or feet ≈øhew it ≈øelf fir≈øt, the Midwife, with a ≈øoft and gentle hand, moi≈øtened with broth of Fenugreek and Lin≈øeed, ≈øhall gently reduce it into the place.</p>
                           <p>Certain women have the mouth of their womb ≈øo ≈øtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that without great help, ≈øcarce or never they can part with the child. And that cometh to pa≈øs by rea≈øon of divers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes; for either ≈øome ≈øtrong heat coming from the natural parts, doth two much ≈øtreighten the inward parts, or the Creature is to big, or the child-bearing woman is to gro≈ø≈øe and fat, or the child is dead, who cannot by motion be furthering and helping to nature, or el≈øe cold for the mo≈øt part in the winter, e≈øpecially in young ones, who have a narrow pa≈ø≈øage of the womb, doth more a≈øtringe and bind it up; or ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heat in ≈øome is ≈øo di≈ø≈øolved, that their ≈øtrength faileth them in the birth.</p>
                           <p>Therefore when there appeareth difficulty in bringing forth the Child, Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the onely pre≈øerver and ≈øaver in danger, is heartily to be called upon, that with his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious favour he would be plea≈øed to be A≈ø≈øi≈øtant to the wretched party in travell.</p>

Moreover, let the linnen cloth, wherein they are wrapped, be neat and clean, for children are offended, and infected by foul and filthy excrements.</p>
                           <p>From three years of age till the ≈øeventh, they are to be educated gently and kindly, not to be ≈øeverely reprehended, chidden, or beaten, for by that meanes they be made through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole life after too timorous, or too much terrified, a≈øtoni≈øhed, and ≈øotted.</p>
                           <p>Being yet in their fir≈øt years, they are not to be compelled to going, for ≈øeeing all their bones are ≈øoft as Wax, and the body fall the heavier, they either become lame, or univer≈øally re≈øolved in their feet.</p>

three years old; for if they be much filled, they are ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and accu≈øtomed to be troubled with Convul≈øions, and other di≈øea≈øes.</p>
                           <p>In the ≈øixth or ≈øeventh year of their age, they are to be ≈øent to ≈øchoole, and committed to the breeding and in≈øtruction of courteous and temperate Schoolma≈øters, who may not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them.</p>

                           <p>Till two years old give them Honey often, for that keepeth them from Convul≈øions, and co≈øtivene≈ø≈øe of the belly, and that the milk they eat hurt them not.</p>
                           <p>When Infants ca≈øt up their milk, a Corrall ≈øhould be hung about their neck down to their middle; for it is u≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them in teething, and Ivory al≈øo is good for the ≈øame purpo≈øe.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> Sheweth how to prevent the Plague.</head>
                     <p>THere are three principall meanes how to prevent this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious di≈øea≈øe: The fir≈øt and chiefe≈øt is to acknowledge our manifold ≈øins and wickedne≈øs unto almighty God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, with a hearty repentance and amendment of our former ≈øins committed again≈øt his divine maje≈øtie.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øecond means is to fly far off from the place infected, and as <hi>Rondoletius</hi> ≈øaith, not over ha≈øtily to return thither again for fear of an after-clap: which ≈øaying is confirmed by <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in the≈øe words, <hi>Non enim morietur in bello, qui non e≈øt in illo:</hi> and the farther from it, the ≈øafer ≈øhall we be, yet were it a very uncharitable cour≈øe that all which are of abillity ≈øhould do ≈øo, for then how ≈øhould the poor be relieved, and good orders ob≈øerved: but for Children it were be≈øt to ≈øend them far off from the place, becau≈øe their bodies are mo≈øt apt to receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as al≈øo for that they cannot ≈øo continually u≈øe antidots and pre≈øervatives, which by their great heat may indanger them almo≈øt ≈øo much as the di≈øea≈øe it ≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>The third meanes con≈øi≈øteth chiefly in three points, which are the≈øe: Order, Diet, and Phy≈øicall helps. For the fir≈øt you ≈øhall have a care that your hou≈øes be kept clean and ≈øweet, not ≈øuffering any foule and filthy clothes or ≈øtinking things to remain in or about the ≈øame: and in ≈øummer ≈øea≈øon to deck your windowes, and ≈øtrow your floors with ≈øweet and whol≈øom hearbs, floures, and leaves, of Mints, Balme, Penniroyall, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, Time, Majoram, red-Ro≈øes, Carnations, Gelliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ≈øuch like for your windowes, your floors to be ≈øtrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with green Ru≈øhes, and Mints, Oaken and Willow leaves, Vine leaves and ≈øuch like: your windowes which ≈øtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North and Ea≈øt, do you alwaies keep open in the day time, if the ayre be clear, and that no infected and un≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory ≈ømell be near the ≈øame, as Fogs, dunghils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every morning before you open either your doors, or windowes, as al≈øo in the evening when you go to bed, cau≈øe a good fire to be made in your Chamber, and burn ≈øome odoriferous or

≈øweet perfumes in the midde≈øt thereof, as hereafter I will ≈øhew you, or in ≈øtead thereof ≈øome Juniper, Frankincen≈øe, Bay leaves, Ro≈øemary, Lavender, Majoram, or ≈øuch like, which you mu≈øt alwaies have dried in a readine≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo in the fume or ≈ømoke thereof to breath and perfume the clothes which you are to weare.</p>

There are foure intentions required for the curing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; that is, by bloud-letting, Cordials, ≈øweat and purging: but the manner how to execute the ≈øame, hath bred great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both among≈øt the old and later Writers, which here to treat of were too tedious, for unto the learned it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe, and for the commonalty little would it availe them, therefore in breif will I ≈øhew you what I have ob≈øerved touching the cure.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, if it be in a Plethorick, ≈øanguine, and ≈øtrong body, and hath pain in the head, great heat at the heart, thir≈øtne≈ø≈øe, the pul≈øe ≈øtrong, and labouring, or beating ≈øtrongly, and hath great and large veines appearing; the≈øe ought pre≈øently to be let bloud in that ≈øide where yee perceive the greif doth prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

it ≈øelfe to come forth, and not vi≈øibly appearing, tending to maturation: For then we may not draw bloud, but u≈øe all other meanes we can devi≈øe, in helping nature to expell it, neither may you draw bloud, if the party have a flix or lask (which is an evill ≈øign) in the beginning of the di≈øea≈øe, for by that meanes you ≈øhall hinder nature greatly, but onely give the party Cordials; neither may you ≈øtop the flix in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but if it be extream, and that it ≈øtay not the ≈øecond day, then mu≈øt you give ≈øome purgation, which may leave an a≈øtringency behind it, as hereafter in the cure of the flix ≈øhall be ≈øhewed. For as <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> in his fir≈øt book and one and twentieth Aphori≈øme, doth admoni≈øh us, we mu≈øt con≈øider and mark, how nature doth incline her ≈øelf, for that will teach us what we are to doe.</p>
                     <p>Now if you perceive the botch or carbunkle to appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the chin about the throat, then pre≈øently draw bloud in both veines under the tongue, and immediately after that apply a cupping gla≈ø≈øe; with ≈øcarification in one ≈øide of the neck next unto the fore, thereby to draw it from the throat, for fear lea≈øt ≈øuddenly it choke him up, and then apply Chickens rumps, or Hens rumps to the botch, the feathers being fir≈øt pluckt away from the rump, and a grain of Salt put into the tewell, and ≈øo hold the bare place to the greif untill the Chicken die, which will be within half an hour, and then apply another, and ≈øo continue in changing them ≈øo long as they doe die, and la≈øtly apply a mollificative Catapla≈øme or plai≈øter to the ≈øame place, as in the fift Chapter following is ≈øhewed, which is made with <hi>

                     <p>If in the groin or flanke he doth complain, then let him bloud in the foot on the ≈øame ≈øide, and open the vein called <hi>Maleola,</hi> or <hi>Saphena,</hi> the quantity mu≈øt be according as the age and ≈øtrength of the party requireth, but at mo≈øt draw not above ≈øix or eight ounces: For <hi>Avicen</hi> willeth us, to pre≈øerve bloud as the trea≈øure of nature.</p>

                     <p>And here you ≈øhall under≈øtand, that unle≈ø≈øe Phlebotomy be done at the fir≈øt, that is, within ≈øix or eight houres at mo≈øt, it will be too late to attempt it, neither may you doe it if the ≈øore doe appear up in height tending to ≈øuppuration, for then ≈øhould you hinder nature, which like a diligent workman, hath di≈øcharged and thru≈øt forth that venomous matter, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe would have killed us.</p>
                     <p>And here touching Phlebotomy or bloud-letting, you mu≈øt have this ≈øpeciall care, that you draw not bloud on the oppo≈øite ≈øide, as if it be on the left ≈øide the ≈øore appear, then draw not bloud on the right ≈øide; if it appear in the flanke, then draw not bloud in the arme, but in the foot, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe you ≈øhall draw that venomous matter from the ignoble unto the noble parts, and ≈øo kill the body.</p>
                     <p>And although the party complain not more in the one ≈øide then the other, yet by the pul≈øe ≈øhall you perceive on which ≈øide the venome lieth hidden, for on that ≈øide where nature is oppre≈øt, there ≈øhall you find the pul≈øe more weak, feeble, and uneven, greatly differing from the other ≈øide.</p>
                     <p>And here you ≈øhall under≈øtand, that in ≈øome it hath been ≈øeen, that nature of it ≈øelf at the fir≈øt, hath thru≈øt out that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous matter in ≈øome place of the body, with a botch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing high, and tending to ≈øuppuration, or a carbunckle, or ≈øpots called purples.

                        <head>The cau≈øe of the Pox and Mea≈øels.</head>
                        <p>The primitive cau≈øe as <hi>Valetius</hi> ≈øaith, is by alteration of the aire, in drawing ≈øome putrified and corrupt quality unto it, which doth cau≈øe an ebullition of our bloud.</p>
                        <p>The cau≈øe antecedent is repletion of meats, which do ea≈øily corrupt in the ≈øtomack, as when we eat milk and fi≈øh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at one time, or by neglecting to draw bloud, in ≈øuch as have accu≈øtomed to doe it every year, whereby the bloud doth abound.</p>
                        <p>The conjunct cau≈øe is the men≈øtruall bloud, which from the beginning in our mothers wombs wee received, the which mixing it ≈øelf with the re≈øt of our bloud, doth cau≈øe an Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the whole.</p>
                        <p>The efficient cau≈øe is, nature or naturall heat, which by that men≈øtruall matter mixing it ≈øelf with the re≈øt of our blouds doth cau≈øe a continuall vexing and di≈øquieting thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an unnaturall heat is increa≈øed in all the body, cau≈øing an Ebullition of bloud, by the which this filthy men≈øtrual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45531:326"/>
is ≈øeperated from our natural bloud, and the nature being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and overwhelmed therewith, doth thru≈øt it to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pores of the skin as the excrements of bloud, which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if it be hot and ≈ølimie, then it produceth the Pox, but if dry and ≈øubtil, then the Mea≈øels or Males. But <hi>Mercurialis</hi> an excellent writer in Phy≈øick, in his fir≈øt Book, <hi>de morbis puero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, cap.</hi> 2. agreeing with <hi>Fernelius</hi> in his Book <hi>De abdit is rerum cau≈øis, c.</hi> 12. doth hold opinion, that the immediate cau≈øe of this di≈øea≈øe doth not proceed of men≈øtrual bloud, but of ≈øome ≈øecret and unknown corruption, or defiled quality of the aire, cau≈øing an Ebullition of bloud, which is al≈øo verified by <hi>Valetius,</hi> and now doth reckon it to be one of the hereditable di≈øea≈øes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe few or none doe e≈øcape it, but that either in their youth, ripe age, or old age, they are infected therewith. The contention hereabout is great, and mighty rea≈øons are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned on both ≈øides, therefore I will leave the judgement thereof unto the better learned to define; but mine opinion is, That now it proceedeth of the Excrements of all the four humours in our bodies, which ≈øtriving with the pure≈øt, doth cau≈øe a ≈øupernatural heat and ebullition of our bloud, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beginning with a Fever in the mo≈øt part, and may well be reckoned in the number of tho≈øe di≈øea≈øes which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Epidemia:</hi> as <hi>Fraca≈øtorius</hi> in his fir≈øt Book, <hi>De morbis contag. cap.</hi> 13. witne≈ø≈øeth this di≈øea≈øe is very contagious and infectious, as experience teacheth us: There are two ≈øpeciall cau≈øes why this di≈øea≈øe is infectious: The fir≈øt is, be cau≈øe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth by ebullition of bloud, who≈øe vapour being entred into another bodie, doth ≈øoon defile and infect the ≈øame, the ≈øecond rea≈øon is, becau≈øe it is a di≈øea≈øe hereditable; for we ≈øee when one is infected therewith, that ≈øo many as come neer him, (e≈øpecially tho≈øe which are allyed in the ≈øame bloud) doe a≈ø≈øuredly for the mo≈øt part, receive the infection al≈øo.</p>
