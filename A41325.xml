            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>You write <hi>Pag.</hi> 205. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Maſtication. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Aliment ought to paſſe into a liquid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, or tendance to Chilificative mutation, or Alimentall converſion, therefore Maſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be highly commended.</p>

Doctor <hi>Charlton;</hi> a Learned Phyſitian, a favourer of <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> that he had a better Faculty, <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere opiniones Veterum, quam extruere, &amp; ſtabilire Novas.</hi>

                  <p>When was ever Practice amongſt the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſo narrowly confined, as they kept themſelves to one Author? Do not ſome of them follow <hi>Minfect,</hi> others <hi>Hartman,</hi> others <hi>Grulingius,</hi> others will have their preſcriptions made after <hi>Querce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Faber,</hi> or <hi>Poterius,</hi> ſome after <hi>Begvinus, Millius, Billich, Burgravius, Becherus,</hi> or other Authors; And ſome diſguſt all, which are not <hi>Paracelſian,</hi> or accord with <hi>Baſilius, Valentinus</hi> his Maſter, and are pleaſed to practiſe after their Medicines, with the additions of their own Experiments, out of their reading, and judegment on their ſeverall Authors. I would gladly know who ties himſelfe to <hi>Sennertus, Riverius,</hi> or any one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Author, as if univerſall Learning were contained in the ſphere of one Microcoſme: Yet you are ſo much for <hi>Helmont,</hi> as if he were the great Luminary of the World. I confeſſe, I honour <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> but if you do no cures out of the tract of his Method, I beleeve you muſt ſtudy more knowledge in his Medicines then barely how to Tranſlate them, or otherwiſe you

will faile in the honour you aſpire unto, and from teaching others, come your ſelfe to learn from thoſe you unworthily vilifie.</p>
                  <p>You ſay <hi>Pag.</hi> 12. The Schooles are ignorant of the Quiddities, and Dihoties of things, do you your ſelfe underſtand either your own, or the eſſence of the loweſt inferiour Animals? <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. Why did you not by the golden Trident of Chymicall Theoremes, whom as a Lady of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you have courted, devoutly kiſſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe your ſtrict obſervance to, becalm this Sea of diſtraction? And as you ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. write in that, in which there is no beaten path, which you think moſt honourable, becauſe he that leades hath this advantage above others, if others follow him, he hath the glory of the firſt undertaking, if not the excuſe of prejudice: But had not <hi>Van Helmont</hi> traced out this Path to you, I could think you would have acquieſced to the ancient opinions, and not have aſpired to be reckoned amongſt the publick Benefactors of Civill and Humane life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 35. You have a jerke at <hi>Bartholomeus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richterus,</hi> but I beleeve your own learning and judgment will hardly bring you to be a Phyſitian to ſo great an Emperour as <hi>Maximillian</hi> the

Second. For your threefold Character you give of a good Purge, <hi>Pag.</hi> 80. I hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve your Patients will be ſo happy as to meet with ſuch from you. The <hi>London</hi> Diſpenſatory hath variety of medicines, ſome following one Author, and ſome another, for which purpoſe it was ſo enlarged, as thought neceſſary in reſpect of the ſeverall variety of judgment, and practiſes of our Modern Phyſitians.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. reading is no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to knowing: If you had never read <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> you had never written in this ſtile. You ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. The diſeaſe known is not the halfe way to the cure, but if you know not the diſeaſe, I conceive you would hardly, or blindly come to the cure of them. You write, <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. The Phyſitians like to the ſelf-conceited <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> while they preſume they keep the keyes of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they neither enter themſelves into the Cloſet, and inner Parlour of Nature, nor admit, willingly, others that would. But obſerve your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſpection and levitie: For had you peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their <hi>Pharmacopoea,</hi> publiſhed 1650. <hi>A Capite ad Calcèm,</hi> you could not have committed ſo groſſe an error, (nor did their former want pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of Chymick medicines) but if you

                  <p>And had you but caſt your eye on their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expreſsion, in <hi>fine Pharmacopoeae,</hi> you would have been ſilent, or written more temperately, which I muſt expoſe to your knowledge in their own words.</p>

You ſay, <hi>If any want wiſdome, let him aske it of God, not of the Colledge of Phyſitians;</hi> and yet you undertake to teach them; for you ſay, <hi>You intend to lay down ſome Rules, whereby a man may as well prevent a ſickneſſe before it comes, as reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it when it comes, and that you will write of the preſervation of man, even from his conception to his grave:</hi> a great undertaking, and I beleeve too high

Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> for your reading, and will ſcarce be gained out of your tranſlating ſome fragments of <hi>Galens,</hi> and ſome pieces of modern <hi>Anatomy.</hi> You ſay, <hi>Phyſitians of our times keep our underſtanding in as great bondage as</hi> Pharoah <hi>kept the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Midwifes bodies,</hi> I pray did the other Phyſitians before them walke in your tract? but why tranſcend you the text with your fooliſh additions? what bondage do you read of either the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes, or women ſuffered under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> themſelves, though the males were overcharged with rigor. You confeſſe <hi>God hath given you ſome little ſparkes of Knowledge, and you will not wrap up your talent in a napkin and bury it in the ground:</hi> Truly I thinke you need not hide any you have; and for that of rayling you will not. You deſire others <hi>to judge charitably of you, for Charity and Honeſty you ſay alwaies walk hand in hand together, and think ill of no man:</hi> If your own rule be your judge, you are neither Charitable nor Honeſt: you ſay in your Epiſtle to the Reader, <hi>The water may be mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the ſtream, which is clear in the Fountain,</hi> but yours is clear in neither: You ſay, <hi>The Tranſlators have given us a Tranſlation of the Bible</hi> (ſuch a one as it is) <hi>but have given all the proper names in Scripture in pure</hi> Hebrew <hi>words in an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and yet all the Scripture was written for our inſtruction:</hi> Had you been as well verſed in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45531:17"/>
Tranſlations, as you are in raſh Cenſures, you might have found the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words exactly interpreted, adjoyned to many tranſlations: not conceived ſo neceſſary to be joyned to all; becauſe whoſoever underſtood the language well (as God be praiſed many of our Nation do) they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not that key to open it to them: Beſides you ſay, <hi>whole Sentences in Scripture are ſo tranſlated, that it would make a man ſick to ſee them,</hi> I beleeve you mean read them; but why quoate you not the places, as you did before, the fourth or fifth first Chapters of the Book of <hi>Chronicles.</hi> If you had ſaid ſome ſentences of Scripture are omitted, or perverted, you might juſtly have taxed the lazie ignorant Printers, both here and beyond the Seas, in theſe times, that have not had ſo much care of their Preſſes in putting forth thoſe ſacred Bookes, as your Printer hath had of yours. You ſay, <hi>The firſt vertue a Child aimes at ſo ſoon as it is born is knowledge.</hi> I would gladly learn what Virtue is <hi>native;</hi> I conceive them <hi>dative,</hi> and that <hi>ſcientia</hi> is rather <hi>acquiſita,</hi> then <hi>nata,</hi> if it be true <hi>nemo naſcitur artifex;</hi> or the Platonick opinion hold, man is <hi>Tabala raſa,</hi> capeable of impreſsions, but hath none writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it. The deſire to be as Gods was the cauſe of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents firſt fall, knowledge of good and evill, but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good comes onely from God, the Fountaine of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in whoſe ſtream you muſt be dipped, before you deſert your pride, and ſelfe-love, and put on humility. You ſay,

                     <hi>Had not the Prieſts formerly abſconded the myſteries of Truth from us, Sermons would have been ſo cheape that they would have been cried about ſtreets for three halfpence a dozen;</hi> You might have done well to have expreſſed your ſelfe, whether you meant our Prieſts, or the <hi>Romane,</hi> for I dare juſtifie a few of the Sermons of our late reverend Divines, as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes, Hierons, Holſworth, Adams,</hi> and many others which I could name, are of farr greater worth and eſteeme, then your diſpenſatory, unleſſe with ſome ignorants and women: Though you undervalue Sermons at a leſſe rate then ſparrowes, when your learned labours are prized at five or ſix ſhillings a piece. For <hi>Gardiner,</hi> I think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Chriſtian abhorreth his name and life; and I know no man deſires to die his death. Gyant proportions have often Pigmy conceits, but our gentlemans fancy farre out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrips. Bayards leape, <hi>who brings</hi> Dianas <hi>Image from</hi> Epheſus <hi>to jumpe to</hi> England <hi>at one leape, where ſilver ſhrines muſt be made for her ſtill.</hi> It is a Riddle to my underſtanding, where the Image and Shrines are; and I ſhould be glad to ſee you cleare that paſſage, of the Image fell downe from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and that of the ſilver ſhrines from impertinent nonſence, and ſhew how you can make them correſpond with our Phyſitians. Tis true you put an effigies Image, or ſculpture before every book you write; I conceive you meane not your owne, I confeſſe I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45531:18"/>
have that in your Book at <hi>Amen Corner,</hi> but for your Silver ſmith and ſhrines you write of, I hardly beleeve you will have one, unleſſe the Midwifes you flatter ſo, make you one. For <hi>Amen Corner,</hi> I perſwade my ſelfe, tis a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable place to you, for feare of diſſection, for you never durſt hitherto venture your approbation there before the Doctors for your ſufficiency in your trade you were bound to, and ſome-while brought up in: And for your judgement in Phyſick, I know you dare not come thither to the teſt, though you raile againſt them. Pray let me not trouble your weake braines with a relation of a Gentleman and Scholars, cenſure upon your Book, who peruſing ſome paſſages in it in a Bookſellers ſhop, asked whether <hi>Culpeper</hi> made that obſceane book or no, and being anſwered he did, replied, truly <hi>Culpeper</hi> hath made Cul-paper, paper fit to wipe ones breech withall. Where you writ, <hi>You could have written deeper notions in Phyſick then ſhall be found in this book:</hi> I muſt tell you, you would ſeeme to be a Phyſitian, who have ſcarce aſpired to the Apothecary. <hi>But the Colledg hath wrapt up their Children in blankets of ignorance,</hi> have they not ſhut them up in a Chamber, as tis related your Patron ſometines did you: you ſay, <hi>man may meddle with generalls, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he meddle with particulars, let him looke to himſelfe:</hi> But you have <hi>Lynceus</hi> eyes in others affaires, <hi>ſed non vides manticae quod in tergo eſt.</hi> He is a

Were you aſleep or awake when you ſaw it jumpe ſo farr, otherwiſe I ſhall think it like one of the ſtories in the <hi>Mirror of Knighthood.</hi> Every bird thinks his own young one faireſt <hi>ſuum cuique pulchrum,</hi> you acknowledge the direction for Midwives to be your own child, but whether you are more properly a borrower or tranſlator, then Father, <hi>Judicent Medici.</hi> Tis a ſlovenly Bird bewrayes his own neſt and though you ſeem to adhere to <hi>Hypocrates</hi> you ſhall never be counted <hi>Harpocrates</hi> for he was borne with one hand on his mouth, and the other on his members, but you will cloſe yours upon neither. But I will conclude with our <hi>Mercury,</hi> with a ſtory of <hi>Mercury</hi> out of our Latine Emblems. <hi>Mercury</hi> having a good conceipt of himſelfe (as our <hi>Mercury</hi> hath) deſirous to know what opinions mortalls conceived of him, would needs deſcend, and fixed on a Statuaries ſhop, where lighting and comming in, he ſpies many Images of the Gods and Goddeſſes, and enquires the price of them but not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his owne, enquires whether he had the Statue of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45531:19"/>
or no, he replied he had, and fetched him forth of a bye corner he had in his ſhop of whom <hi>Mercury</hi> demanded what price he would aske for it, the Statuary replyed, Sir, If you mean in good earneſt to buy the other Statues you Cheapned, you ſhall have him into the bargain, whereupon <hi>Mercury</hi> went away diſcontented, I leave the Morall to your own application: and your ſelfe alſo; wiſhing you more government in your tongue, and diſcreſsion in your pen, hereafter, concluding with that ſaying, <hi>His tongue is no ſlander, whoſe tongue is all ſlander,</hi>

                     <p>There are many which diſorder themſelves in their eating,

and in the varietie and ſuperfluitie of meats, and ſo corrupt themſelves; and of ſuch corruption engendreth ill diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtomack, and loſſe of appetite, and thence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Itch, and diſeaſes of the legs, and other like matters, which commonly proceed of much repletion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Others diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves in the exceſs of Lecherie, of which diſorder cometh debilitie of the Reins, want of the ſight, weakneſs of the brains, and oftentimes diſeaſes about the Yard, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of infirmities hanging upon the French ſickneſſe. Some diſorder themſelves in fiſhing, ſtanding much in the water; and of this acceſſe cometh coldneſſe of the Nerves, pains of the legs and feet, and ſuch other things which ſuch acceſſe cauſeth. Other ſome diſorder themſelves in hunting, in ſuch ſort, as they take heat, cold, wearineſs, hunger and thirſt; of which diſorder there followeth Agues, Opilations, Rheums, Numneſſe, and ſuch like things; which, with ſuch diſorder and great travell, commonly are wont to bee cauſed. And in divers other manners men may diſorder themſelves, which at this time I will omit, becauſe I will not be over-tedious to the Reader. It ſufficeth, ſo that I ſhew the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the thing, and to doe it, that every one may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. If then the cauſes are infinite, by which infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities or ſickneſs come, and the remedies a great many more then enough to cure them: I mean therefore to ſet down in the Chapters following the infirmities, together with the remedies, with the which they may be healed, beginning with the infirmities which men have from their birth unto their death, diſcourſing of them one after an other. And firſt I will ſpeak of Infants and children, which happen into the falling ſickneſſe aſſoon as they are born.</p>

                     <p>THe Falling Sickneſs is a diſeaſe, the which in young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is cauſed of great humiditie in the head, and the cure thereof according to our Order, is with drying things
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45531:21"/>
which diſſolveth that humiditie, and the Remedie is this: Take our <hi>Cerot Magiſtrale,</hi> and ſpread it on a cloth the breadth of two fingers ſquare, and ſtrew thereon the powder of <hi>Cantharides:</hi> the which of his own quality and nature is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, and bringeth forth great quantity of water: then lay this <hi>Cerot</hi> in the nuke of the neck, and there let it lye at the leaſt eight or ten daies, taking it off every day, and making it clean, then lay it on that place again. Likewiſe you ſhall annoint the head with <hi>Oleum Petroleum,</hi> the which is very dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and penetrative; becauſe it cometh forth of a Mine under the earth, the which continually doth boil, and ſo cometh forth with the water, and then is ſeparated. This Oil hath a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous vertue in himſelf, that it defendeth the fire, for if a man annoint his hands therewith, he may waſh his hands with molten Lead preſently, and never hurt him: and that cometh through a certain hidden vertue in that Oil. Alſo you ſhall underſtand, that this Oil will burn being ſet on fire, and yet it will not hurt or ſcald any thing which it falleth on, or toucheth it.</p>

                     <p>THeſe groſſe ſcabs that come in the head and face, are cauſed of abundance of fatneſs, and moiſture of the milk of the Nurſe; for the child being tender and weak of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, is not apt to digeſt that ſuperfluous humour, and ſo Nature driveth it forth in that order, with great abundance of humiditie, And the beſt remedie is, That you ſhall give the child every morning one ſcruple to drinke, of our <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixar vitae,</hi> becauſe it is a friend to Nature, and nouriſheth the bodie, and drieth up ſuperfluous moiſture, and ſo the child ſhall be holpen.

                     <p>THe Small Pox are cauſed of ſuperfluous choller and flegm, the which is mixed with the bloud, and ſo continuing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time it doth encreaſe ſo much, that Nature cannot bear it, and ſo driveth it forth with a great accident of a Fever, the which commonly doth continue four or five daies together, and then cometh forth certain wheals or bladders full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which within three daies will break and run forth, and many drie. You ſhall underſtand that there are ſome ſo weak of Nature that they cannot come forth, but remain within, and ſo having no evaporation outwardly, it doth choak them, and ſo die, and that is the cauſe why ſo many creatures from four yeers old to ten doe die without help. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the true cauſe of the diſeaſe, I have alſo found out the true remedie to help them, and that is this. When the child feeleth that Accident, give him preſently one drachm
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45531:22"/>
of our <hi>Aromatico</hi> to eat: The which hath ſuch force and vertue attractive, that it joyning unto the ſtomack draweth unto it all the humours that offend, and carrieth them forth both by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and ſege, and ſo leaveth Nature eaſed, and the partie out of danger.

                     <p>Firſt therefore thou ſhalt give them our Sirrup againſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick humours, written in our diſcourſe of Chirurgerie, and then give him a Doſe of our <hi>Aromatico</hi> faſting, and that will evacuate the ſtomack of choler and flegm, and drie up thoſe humours that run to the ſores.

                     <p>THe running of the Reins moſt commonly cometh of the much uſe of women, or becauſe thoſe women are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with a certain diſtemperature of heat, that is able to corrupt a man uſing with her.

There may come alſo a great burning in the Yeard, and botches in the Groin, and ſuch like, all which are hard to bee diſſolved.

The ſecret is this, Thou ſhalt underſtand, that the beginning of <hi>Pellarella,</hi> is one <hi>Carvoli</hi> or more that cometh upon the Yeard, the which ſeemeth to be of little importance, becauſe they are holpen with eaſe, but within ten, or fifteen daies after they are whole, there will come a certaine alteration in the throate, which will not ſuffer him to ſwallow his meat, which doth indure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eight or ten daies, and ſo goe away by it ſelfe without any medicine, and in that time the haire is mortified, and then within two or three moneths the haire will fall: ſo that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45531:25"/>
this is the cauſe why they cannot be help'd when they fall away, for the time was paſſed before, and the rootes mortified. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou wilt keep thy ſelf from running into ſuch a great danger, thou maieſt do it eaſily if thou take it in time: and the remedie is this. When you have had any of theſe <hi>Carvoli,</hi> and that after there cometh an alteration in the throate, then preſently purge, and uſe a defenſive unction that the haire may not mortifie. You ſhall purge him nine dayes every morning with our <hi>Sirupo Magiſtrale,</hi> and faſt thereon four houres. The doſe is from ℥ iii. to ℥ vi. that being done, you ſhall give him ℥. <hi>di.</hi> of <hi>Electuario Angelica,</hi> according to the recept, and in the mean time annoint all his face and head with our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and doing thus, it is not poſſible that the haire ſhould fall off. This is a ſecret, the which few men have known, and never written of any before this time, and is of ſo great importance, that it were neceſſarie to be known for an univerſall health, that every man might keep himſelf from this diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>THe Cough cometh divers and ſundry waies to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, as by cold, and that is one of the moſt common cauſes that may be, and is of ſmall importance, becauſe it will goe away of it ſelfe without medicine. There is another kind of Cough that troubleth much old folke, and that is of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhous humour. The third kind of Cough written of by us, is that which cometh to thoſe that have the Fever <hi>Hectick.</hi> Alſo there is another kind which is cauſed of the French Pox. And theſe are the foure kindes of Coughes that do commonly happen vnto men and women. The firſt kind of Cough that happeneth unto man through cold, is eaſie to be helped, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it ſelf will help it without any other helpe: but if thou wilt helpe nature thou maieſt with eaſe, and that ſhall be with eating drie and apperatiue meates, and drinking good wine, and ſo the Cough will goe away quickly. But the Cough which cometh to old folk, is cauſed of a Catarrhous humour, which is nothing elſe but debilitie of nature, for lack of naturall heat, the which cauſeth the ſtomack that it cannot digeſt his meate in ſuch order as it ſhould, but ingendreth thoſe ſuperfluous humours, that cauſe the Cough. And this muſt be helped with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45531:26"/>
keeping of diet; that is, to eat little meat, and to uſe thing that warm the ſtomack and help digeſtion, and this thou ſhalt doe in this order. Take <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. ii. of our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> which hath vertue to evacuate the ſtomack, and then uſe our <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> of Wine, and annoint the ſtomack with our <hi>Balm artificiall,</hi> and ſo ſhalt thou help this kind of Cough. The third kind of Cough, which is cauſed of the Fever He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick, is of evill nature, that I dare ſay nothing nor ſhew a Medicine, becauſe the moſt part that are troubled therewith, go to Church and never return again to their houſes, as you may ſee by experience. The fourth kind of Cough is devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and evill to help, becauſe it is cauſed of the Pox, and doth not onely hurt the ſtomack, but cauſeth great pains to the partie beſide. Nevertheleſſe, thou ſhalt underſtand that this is eaſie to he helped by Gods grace, for them that know the true ſecret, which is thus: You ſhall give him eight or ten daies together our <hi>Soluble Sirrup,</hi> then take two drachms of our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> and then perfume him with <hi>Cinabar</hi> five or ſix mornings, or ſo long untill that he feel pain in his gums, and then hee ſhall be whole.

                     <p>THis Scab is of an evill corruption in the ſuperiour parts, which is cauſed of abundance of moiſture, and heat of the Stomack, which ſendeth theſe vapours up to the head, and ſo goeth out that way. This is of two kindes, the one is hot and dry, and that is with a certain white cruſt, without any other kind of putrefaction: the other kind is hot and moiſt, and that cauſeth a certain cruſt, which is full of matter under it; ſo that as they differ in qualitie, they differ alſo in cure. Thoſe that are hot and dry, muſt have Medicines that cool the heat, and extinguiſh the drineſſe, and this thou ſhalt doe with Sirrup of <hi>Citarch,</hi> and purge often with <hi>Caſsia,</hi> and uſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45531:27"/>
cooling things, as <hi>Succorie, Melons, Lettice,</hi> and ſuch like. The other kinde which is hot and moiſt, you muſt firſt help the heat, and then dry the humiditie, which you ſhall doe with vomiting, and purging, and keeping diet, and eating of drying meats. The firſt drying ſcab you ſhall annoint one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> which without help of any other thing, will cure it after they be purged, as is before ſaid. The ſecond kind you ſhall help, after the bodie is purged with our <hi>Cerot Magiſtrale,</hi> ſtrewing thereon <hi>Cantharides</hi> in fine powder, which have vertue attractive; by which means it mundifieth the head of that ſuperfluous humiditie, and then annoint him with our <hi>

And ſo by this means thou mayeſt heal theſe two kinds of Scabs, as I have done divers times, having reſpect to the cauſe. Ye ſhall underſtand that this diſeaſe is many times taken from the Nurſe, the which is infected with the Pox, and ſo her milk being corrupted, it corrupteth the child, and therfore there muſt be good conſideration thereof in the cure.</p>

                     <p>THe Fever <hi>Quotidian</hi> or continuall Fever, or any other kind whatſoever, do proceed onely of two principall cauſes, that is, of corruption and putrefaction, as you may perceive how that when the Fever is entred, the Patient is all corrupted, beginning at the ſtomack, the which is firſt corrupted. For proof you may alwaies ſee that aſſoon as a man is ſick, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45531:28"/>
he looſeth his appetite and cannot eat; afterward it corrupteth the blood, for by experience, if you let them blood, it is alwaies found corrupted, and not as it is in a ſound bodie. It corrupteth alſo the ſenſes, ſo that the ſick is not ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenced, nor cannot ſleep, or reſt by any means whilſt he hath that accident. That it is cauſed alſo of Putrifaction you may ſee by them, that have the Fever. For alwaies when the Fever cometh, preſently the ſtomack doth putrifie, and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth filthy ſpittle: Alſo it doth putrifie the bodie, becauſe their Excrements that they void are putrified and ſtinking more then others, and their Urine putrified and alterated from his naturall courſe. Then ſeeing the Fever is cauſed of corruption and putrifaction, there are four things neceſſarie to be done in the cure thereof. The firſt is, to evacuate the ſtomack: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to purge by urine: The third, to evacuate the bodie: And the fourth is, to purge by ſweat: Which four operations may be done one after another with great eaſe, and will reſtore the Patient to his health. But you ſhall underſtand, that all cannot be holp, for that God almightie hath made us to die, and when that time cometh, medicines will doe no good, but if that time be not yet come, by the help of God, with theſe Medicines he ſhall be reſtored to his former health. The firſt thing, as I ſaid, is to take a vomit, which doth evacuate the ſtomack of choler and flegm, that doth much offend the bodie diſeaſed: After that, evacuate the bodie with thoſe things that the Phyſician thinketh moſt convenient for that purpoſe, for there be many purgations to diſſolve the body, and to evacuate malign humours: After that, make him purge by urine. Fourthly, and laſt of all, give him medicines that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the pores, and that provoketh ſweat. And thus with theſe four operations, the moſt part ſhall be holp of that infirmitie with great eaſe, and in ſhort time: And as I have ſaid, this is a moſt true order that never faileth, except (as I ſaid before) when the Lord will call them. And as for theſe medicines, you ſhall find them written in this book ſeverally with their uſes and quantities.</p>

                     <p>IF thou wilt help the ſaid Fevers according to our order: when the Patient is greatly alterated therewith, thou ſhalt uſe five waies wherewith thou ſhalt eaſily help them, the which are theſe. The firſt as I ſaid before is Vomit: the ſecond eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the body: the third evacuation by urine: the fourth to provoke ſweat: and the fifth by unction. Nevertheleſſe each of theſe alone is ſufficient to help the ſaid Fever: but yet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them all five, there is no doubt but thou maieſt diſſolve any evill ſort of maligne Fever, except as I ſaid before, God will call them out of this World: but to the purpoſe of the cure. Firſt thou ſhalt ſet on five or ſix boxing glaſſes, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and age of the infirmed: then the next morning give him one doſe of our <hi>Electuario angellica,</hi> with Sirrup of Sorrell, and water of Sorrell. Then the next morning following give him ſome Sirrup appropriate for that diſeaſe, and put thereto ℥. ii. of <hi>Sirrupo Magiſtrale,</hi> with <hi>Rhabarbe:</hi> that being ended, give him three or foure times Julep of Violets with Oyle of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> made <hi>per Campana,</hi> the doſe of the Julep is ℥ ii. and of the Oyle of <hi>Sulphur</hi> four or five graines mixed together, and this you ſhall take in ſtead of Sirrup betimes in the morning, and it will make them ſweat and purge by urine, which are moſt neceſſary for the ſick: and in the mean ſeaſon you ſhall annoint them every night with <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> which will make them reſt well, and take away all their paines throughout the body, and ſo by this meanes the Fever ſhall be perfectly taken away. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take great heed that you take no more blood then is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, neither let them keep any ſtraight Diet, but let them keep a good regiment of Life. But when this Feaver doth come through ſome other cauſe, then it were neceſſary to remove the principall cauſe, if thou wilt cure them: For if it be cauſed of a <hi>Catarre,</hi> of neceſſitie you muſt diſſolve the <hi>Catarre</hi> firſt; and then help the Fever. Alſo if the Fever be cauſed of a wound, it were neceſſary firſt to take away the pain of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45531:29"/>
wound, and then the Fever will depart. And thus in every kind of Fever, it is moſt neceſſary to know the originall from whence it is cauſed: And this is the true way to cure theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, which I have proved infinite times.</p>

                     <p>THere are many kindes of Fevers, therefore I will mention of them that are moſt known unto the world, and firſt of the continuall Fever, that is of thoſe that are onely hot, and continue in one order both day and night, the which is caus'd of alteration and corruption of the humours in the body, which engender ſo much corruption in the ſtomack, and in the blood, that they cauſe that accident of Fever: And the very order to cure it is this. In the beginning of the alteration let him keep a good diet, and drink no wine: and that is done becauſe that corruption is apt to corrupt all that entereth into the body du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that alteration, and therefore meates of great ſubſtance or nouriſhment, are ſooner turned into greater putrifaction in the body: But when the third day of the Fever is paſt, then take of our <hi>Aromatico</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. ii. which will evacuate the ſtomack of that corruption: and that day that you take this <hi>Aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> drink as much crude water as you will: which is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtomack ſhall remaine cleare waſhed of that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being done, you ſhall give him three or four morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings our <hi>Soluble Sirrup,</hi> and give him good meates, and let him drink Wine, becauſe it cannot hurt in any wiſe, for it cannot putrife in the body: For the ſirrup doth evacuate every day the corruption: and when the blood is alterated of that putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it goeth to the veines, and ſo diſperſeth through the whole body. It would be good to ſet on boxing glaſſes to take away blood, and alſo to uſe drying unctions, as our <hi>Balſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo artificato,</hi> and Oyle of Turpentine and Wax, and thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if the Patient be not called of God) thou ſhalt helpe him within ſhort ſpace.

                     <p>THeſe Fevers that are not accidentall, that is, not cauſed of a wound or impoſthume, or other kind of infirmitie appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, are cauſed of a certaine humour between the skin and the fleſh, which would have exhalation: as you may ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in this kind of Fever, how that ſweats and boxing is very appropriate to their ſolution. And in this caſe I will ſhew thee a great remedie, with which after convenient purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou mayeſt helpe in manner all thoſe kindes of Fevers. And this is the remedie: Take <hi>Oippa ofir,</hi> the which is a ſimple well known to all the world, take of that hearb a ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſtampe it a little, and lay it upon the wriſt, and bind it hard, and there let it lye untill it have made a bliſter full of water, which you ſhall break, and there will come forth great abundance of water, and by that place the Fever ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. And the reaſon is, becauſe it evacuateth that humour which engendereth the accident: then the cauſe being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the effect will ceaſe, and the Patient ſhall be whole.</p>

                     <p>THe Fever <hi>Tertian</hi> doth not continue in one manner, but cometh and goeth, and is cauſed of chollerick humours: for aſſone as the fit cometh it moveth choller, and in many it provoketh vomite. There are two ſorts of thoſe Fevers, The one cometh with an accident, firſt cold, and then hot: and the other ſort cometh alwaies hot, when the accident com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and ſometimes that accident cometh twice a day, and that is called a double <hi>Tertian,</hi> which is hard to helpe, becauſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting blood, the diet, and purging of the body are all hurtful and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45531:30"/>
contrary to that diſeaſe, therefore I will open to thee a ſecret wherewith thou ſhalt help them. Thou ſhalt give him three hours before the fit <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. of <hi>Eleborus niger</hi> in powder, with ℥. i. of <hi>Mel Roſarum:</hi> and after it drink ℥. i. of common water, and this you ſhall take twiſe, and then uſe this potion ten dayes every morning. Take Julep of Violets ℥. i. fine <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> ℥. <hi>di.</hi> Oyle of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that is perfect iiii. graines, and mixe them together, this mundifieth the ſtomack, and purgeth by urine, and provoketh ſweate, and warmeth the blood: which effects are neceſſary to the ſolution of that Fever, giving you great charge that you keep no ſtraight diet in any wiſe, becauſe it weakneth the ſtomack, cooleth the blood, and hindereth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo that the Patient can ſcarce be helped. But with our order thou ſhalt help the moſt part of that Fever.</p>

                     <p>THis Fever is a viſcous and putrified humour in the ſtomack and lunges, the which is cauſed of a debility and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of nature that cannot digeſt the offenſive humours. There are divers ſorts of this Fever, nevertheleſſe they are all evill to be holpt, and are counted uncurable. Nevertheleſſe, I will ſhew thee ſome excellent remedie very wholſom, that may pleaſure them, although they are nigh their death. The firſt medicine that ſhall do them good, is our <hi>Electuario angellica,</hi> of which you ſhall give halfe an ounce in the morning faſting, for this preſently joyneth unto the ſtomack, and draweth to it all the offenſive humours, and carrieth them forth by vomit and ſeege, and ſo leaveth the ſtomack eaſed and clean, that the Patient thinketh himſelf whole: But yet the ſtomack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth againe to fill with a great ſuffocation, that will not let the Patient take reſt, ſo that this medicine may well eaſe them, but not helpe them quite. Alſo our <hi>Elixar vitae</hi> doth much good in this diſeaſe, and alſo our <hi>Balme artificial:</hi> if you annoint the ſtomack therewith at night when you go to bed. Alſo uſe our diſtillation for the <hi>Hectick:</hi> theſe may all helpe a little but not cure. The Fever <hi>Hectick</hi> may come alſo of a <hi>Catarre,</hi> of the Pox, and ſuch like cauſes, and then they require medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines according to the cauſe: as if the Fever be cauſed of a Catarre, let them uſe our <hi>Magno liquore</hi> to drink, the doſe is one ounce at a time, with halfe an ounce of <hi>Mel Roſarum,</hi> and theſe uſe for a moneth at the leaſt. And if it be cauſed of the Pox, let him take <hi>Sarſaparilla,</hi> or <hi>Lignum vitae, Pillole Aquilone,</hi> or ſuch like that will helpe the Pox: and thus doing, the cure will have good ſucceſſe: but when it is cauſed of debility of Nature (as is ſaid before) they ſpit blood untill the end.</p>

                     <p>MAny have thought that the Fever <hi>Hectick</hi> is altogether deſperate and uncurable, and that by no meanes it might be reſolved: But becauſe it is cauſed of divers and ſundry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, I ſay that many kindes may be helped and cured: For I find it may come of infinite cauſes, as aforeſaid. There is one kind that cometh through the weakneſſe of nature it ſelf, and that beginneth to deſtroy the Lunges, and that kind I find to be incurable, becauſe it is cauſed of the evill nature of the man, and not through any accident, and in that caſe I beleeve it cannot be diſſolved by any meanes. Alſo there are many other <hi>Hecticks</hi> cauſed of the French-Pox, of which I have ſeen and cured an infinite, and they are eaſie to cure: For curing the Pox, the Fever will be diſſolved. There is another kind that dependeth of a ſalt humour, and ſome other of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarre, and of many other things: Therefore if thou wilt help the ſaid Fever, it were neceſſary to know the true cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it dependeth, the which in my judgement is hard to be known, if that the Patient himſelf do not tell it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary for the Phyſitian to examin them well, and to enquire whether they have had any kind or ſpice of the <hi>Mal Franceſe</hi> before, whereof the ſaid Fever might have his original: and ſo doing, he with his judgement may be reſolved of the nature of that infirmity: and if it chaunce that the ſaid Fever had his originall of the Pox, the Phiſician may reſolve it with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines appropriate for that diſeaſe, with purging him ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and giving him <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> or <hi>Salſa pariglia,</hi> and alſo perfume him with <hi>Olibanum Sinaber</hi> and <hi>Mirrha, ana:</hi> and ſo by the help of God, and meanes of theſe medicines thou ſhalt help them all, or at leaſt the moſt part of that kind of Fever <hi>Hectick.</hi> But if the Phiſician find that kind of Fever to be cauſed of a Catarre, then uſe the medicines that help the Catarre, and ſo the Fever ſhall be whole. But when he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45531:32"/>
findeth it to be of the weakneſſe of Nature, in that caſe there is no help that is ſure. Nevertheleſſe, I have cured ſome of them with great difficultie, and with Medicines of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie: And that was with giving them every morning one drachm of good Sope in tablets according to our invention, and that they uſed for a moneth together: the which Sope hath vertue to drie that abundance of ſpittle, and to heal the Lungs ulcerated, and it alſo ſtrengthneth the Stomack marvellouſly: After that I cauſed them to uſe our diſtillation of a Hen for the <hi>Hectick,</hi> and this they did continually drink: Alſo I cauſed them to uſe our <hi>Balsamo artificiato</hi> to annoint therewith every night after Supper, the which is peircing, and comforteth and augmenteth naturall ſtrength, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth much the infirmed: Alſo I cauſed them to uſe <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matico Roſato,</hi> the which comforteth the weak Stomack. And by this meanes I have help'd ſome of them as it well known.</p>

                     <p>THe Fever <hi>Quartane</hi> is cauſed of a melancholie humour as aforeſaid, with a continuall diſtillation of the head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to the ſtomack, and augmenting the evill diſpoſition of the body; and by reaſon of that diſtillation, provoketh much ſweat when the accident of the Fever cometh: And likewiſe that diſtillation cauſeth ſuch cold in the Marrow of the Reins and Back, and an infinite of other diſorders which trouble the bodie greatly. But to avoid all theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and to diſſolve wholly that accident of the <hi>Quartane</hi> according to our order, becauſe I have helped more then any Phyſitian of our time. I will ſhew thee how with theſe Remedies following thou ſhalt help them, though not all, yet the greater part truly moſt miraculouſly, and the Order to diſſolve it is thus. You ſhall give the Patient a doſe of our <hi>Aromatico</hi> in the morning to eat, and drink thereon two or three ounces of good wine, and faſt thereon ſix hours, and this Medicine is moſt convenient the day of the fit, becauſe the infirmitie removeth great quantitie of humours, and the medicine evacuateth them; and thus giving it three times in the day of the fit, it will work a great operation. But if the Fever be in a perſon of melancholie complexion, then it is where it would be; for you may ſee that in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie perſon, the Fever hath more force, then in any other complexion, which proveth, that the Fever, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion are moſt like: But in that caſe you ſhall cure them in this Order: You ſhall give him ten or fifteen daies out
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45531:33"/>
                        <hi>Sirrup</hi> againſt the melancholie humour, which is written in this Book, which you ſhall take two hours before day hot, and then ſleep one ſleep thereon, and thus doe every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and every night annoint all the parts of the body with our <hi>Balſamo artificiato,</hi> and he ſhall be holpen. But if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that this doth not cure him, let not to give him this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which moſt ſurely (God willing) will help him, and that remedie is our <hi>Aqua Balſami,</hi> of which he ſhall take every morning two Drachms faſting, and ſo continue untill the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be gone quite: ſo that of force uſing all the aforeſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, the Fever muſt needs depart. And the reaſon is this, that our <hi>Aromatico</hi> evacuateth the ſtomack of all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by vomit, and letteth the deſcenſion of the head, which cauſeth the accident. Our <hi>Syrrup</hi> evacuateth the melancholie humour, and diſſolveth it by his proper qualitie.

                     <p>ALthough the wiſe &amp; learned of the world, have alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that the Gout is of divers kinds, yet they have all been deceived; for that infirmitie is one onely, and cometh of one onely cauſe, although in ſome it come in manner of <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone,</hi> and in ſome other like <hi>Riſipilla,</hi> and in other <hi>Nodoſa,</hi> and in other with pain without alteration, and in ſome other in divers manners; all which is cauſed through the diverſitie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, for that one man is flegmatick, the other ſanguine, the other cholerick, and the other aduſt, and thus by theſe means, many have thought the Gout to have been of divers kindes, whereas indeed it is onely one, and is cured with one onely order, and diſſolved altogether for ever; for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie is cauſed of no other then of rotten humours cauſed of indigeſtion, and to ſay truth, we ſee that the ſaid infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity never commeth in manner, but unto thoſe perſons that feed well on meats of great nouriſhment, which for want of exerciſe, that Nature might digeſt it, they wanting naturall heat, cannot have their orderly digeſtion, and for that cauſe the humours doe ingroſſſe out of meaſure, and ingender that infirmitie, and then Nature that alwaies ſeeketh to eaſe her ſelf of that which offendeth her, driveth forth that humour unto the extream parts, as the hands, and feet, or other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

parts, and this is the Gout: And theſe humours many times are cauſe of <hi>Mal franceſe,</hi> and this is all the ſecret. He therefore that is advertiſed by me, ſhall be moſt cunning in curing of it.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXVIII.</hi> What order muſt be uſed in curing of the ſaid Gout.</head>
                     <p>SEeing the Gout (as I ſaid before) are groſſe humours undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted coming of the aforeſaid cauſe, it were moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if thou wilt cure them to do three operations. The firſt of them is Phlebothomie, which muſt be done under the tongue, cutting overthwart one of thoſe two veines: For that Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomie evacuateth the ſtomocall humours that are cauſe of that corruption. The ſecond operation that is to be done, is to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubtiliate the groſs and rotten humours, and to evacuate them quite. The third operation that is to be done, is to preſerve nature in good temperature, and to help the digeſtion, and thus doing, the ſaid infirmity ſhall be extincted. If therefore thou wilt helpe the Gout, and after they are helped, keep the Patient in good temperature and proſperity of life, it were neceſſary to do theſe three operations. After the firſt is done, as I have ſaid, it were needfull to come to the ſecond, which is to aſſubtiliate the groſs humours, which will be done with four remedies. The firſt of them is our <hi>Quinta eſſentia ſolutiva,</hi> which ſubtiliateth the humours, and evacuateth them downwards. The ſecond reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is our <hi>Electuario angelica,</hi> which evacuateth the humours hanging in all parts, and leaveth nature ſo eaſed, that it may well prevaile. The third remedie is a Fomentation, which drieth up the humidity of the head and ſtomack, and by meanes of that operation the diſeaſe ſhall remaine extincted. The fourth and laſt remedie is our <hi>Balſamo</hi> againſt the paines, with which you ſhall annoint upon the place grieved, for it mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth the paines greatly. And thus with theſe four remedies thou ſhalt help the Gout perfectly, as I have often times done in <hi>Venice,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in divers other places of <hi>Italy,</hi> well known there unto all men.</p>

The third Remedie is, our <hi>Pillolae aquilonae,</hi> which doth evacuate the humour hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, alwaies when it ingendereth in the ſtomack, they cleanſe the head, and are by their nature againſt all ſorts of pains.

                     <p>THe <hi>Sciatica</hi> is ſo called, becauſe it is upon the bone which is called <hi>Scio,</hi> and of that it taketh the name <hi>Sciatica,</hi> the which is cauſed of an evill qualitie in the Stomack and Liver, the which you may ſee by the cure; for if ye cure the Stomack, and help the Liver, the <hi>Sciatica</hi> will ceaſe, and by this means thou mayeſt ſee whether I ſay the truth or no. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that the <hi>Sciatica</hi> is cauſed as is ſaid before, ye ſhall underſtand that it is ſo cauſed, by reaſon that the ſtomack can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well digeſt that which it ſhould, and ſo it cauſeth crude and undigeſted humours, of the which Nature would be diſcharged, he caſteth them forth of the ſtomack, and having no other way to come forth of the Stomack but by the ordinary waies, they doe paſſe, and of force they muſt paſſe by thoſe powers that paſſe by the Liver, and ſo the Liver which is able both to reſolve the good and the evill qualitie, remaineth ſtill infected of that indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not being able to digeſt them according unto the order of Nature, they ingroſs and become maligne, and then Nature the which with all induſtrie would diſcharge himſelf of that burthen, ſending them to the higher parts, ſendeth them downwards, and when they come unto <hi>Scio,</hi> where they muſt paſſe with difficultie by certain ſmall muſcles, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe in that place, and cauſe inflamation and pain, the

which Inflamation or ſwelling, after the bodie is well purged, is reſolved with <hi>Veſicatores Ventoſos,</hi> and attractive Cerots and ſuch like things.

You ſhall give the Patient a doſe of <hi>Pillolae Aquilonae</hi> faſting, and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon one ſleep, for theſe Pills doe purge the <hi>Matrix,</hi> then take <hi>Electuario Angelica</hi> half an ounce, which purgeth the blood and choller: That being done, take <hi>Cantharides</hi> in powder ℈ i. <hi>Galingale,</hi> and the roots of <hi>Mercury, ana. di. ℈.</hi> mix them altogether, and put it into a little piece of Sarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,

                     <p>THe pain in the Head is a diſeaſe of the brains, which is cauſed of putrified humours in the ſtomack, the which is like unto a pot that boileth, cauſing the vapours to aſcend, which if they be evill, the fume is evill to the taſte and ſmell; but if there boil any good thing therein, the fumes are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant both to the ſmell and taſte. And ſo likewiſe our ſtomack being filled with good juyce, filleth the brain with good fumes; but being filled with evill corrupt humours, it hurteth the brain, and cauſeth pains of the head. The like pains of the head may come of alteration of the blood, and to helpe that accident, you muſt firſt remove the cauſe principall, which is done with purging, and evacuating of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack of thoſe putrified humours; which thou ſhalt do with our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> giving it to the Patient two or thre times, every five daies once. The doſe is <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ii. and then the pain will ceaſe, of what cauſe ſoever it doe come; this done, take the juyce of a Beet root one ounce, Oil of bitter Almonds one drachm; mix them well together, and ſnuffe it up into the noſe every morning untill it come into the mouth, for this doth purge the head marvellouſly; this being done, it would bee

There is one that is called in Italian <hi>Razoni,</hi> and that is cauſed of the heat of the blood, and his effects are certain ſmall wheals that run round about the eye-lids, and this Infirmitie is of ſmall importance, for onely with lina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45531:38"/>
of <hi>Tutia</hi> they may be healed, annointing them three or four times. There is another kind of infirmitie in the eyes that cometh to many, and is cauſed of moiſture and heat in the head, and that is a redneſs with watering and great burning: And although this be troubleſome, yet it is not dangerous to heal. For with purging the head and bodie, and with Boxing glaſſes, and with certain Unctions appropriate they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main whole. There is another kinde of infirmitie in the eie, and that is when the ball of the eie waxeth out of meaſure in greatneſſe, and this is called <hi>Dilatatio pupillae,</hi> the which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to heal. For my part I never ſaw but one remedie that did preſerve it, and that is our <hi>Balſamo Artificiato,</hi> of the which you ſhall put every night one drop into the eie, and it will doe thee great pleaſure, becauſe it is temperate hot, and hath a penetrative vertue and reſolutative, by the which meanes it doth hinder the relaxation, and preſerveth the eie. There is yet another ſort of infirmitie that cauſeth the eie to be full of pain, and cometh all thick and filthy, and blindeth it, and this indiſpoſition is cauſed of <hi>Morbo Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co;</hi> and although it ſeem foul and uncurable: Nevertheleſſe, it is eaſie to be cured if you help the principall cauſe, and fume the head with <hi>Cinabar, Myrrh,</hi> and <hi>Olibanum,</hi> they ſhall be quickly helped. There is another infirmitie that cometh in the eie, the which is a cloud that ingendereth in the point of the eie upon the ball, and hindereth the ſight, and that is eaſie to be helped, for if you drop therein one drop of our <hi>Balm</hi> twentie or thirtie daies together, it will reſolve it throughly.

head, and divers other wayes. Nevertheleſſe, let it come which way it will, it proceedeth of the head and ſtomack, the wihch ſendeth up vapours, and then fall down again, and cauſe that pain, and the remedie is this: Firſt, give them our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrale Syrupo</hi> five or ſix daies, the which purgeth the blood, and evacuateth the bodie; that being done, take our <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuario angelico,</hi> three times according to the receipt, for this evacuateth the ſtomack and purgeth the head; and then take our <hi>Aqua reale,</hi> and hold it in thy mouth a <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> while, and then ſpit it forth again, and with this order thou ſhalt help all manner of pains in the teeth, except they bee rotten ſtumps; and then the beſt way is to take them forth with an Inſtrument: but if thou wilt not take them forth and eaſe the pain, thou mayeſt touch them with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> untill the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be mortified? that being done, you ſhall hold our <hi>Aqua balſami</hi> two or three times in your mouth in a day, untill the pain bee gone, and ſo with this order thou mayeſt keep them without pain.

                     <p>THe ſickneſſe of the Liver is cauſed of divers and ſundry accidents of the bodie, as you may ſee by experience, when a man is never ſo little ſick, by and by the Liver is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and doth no more work well, and that is becauſe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is the receptacle of the blood and of the Gall, and the maſter which ruleth and governeth our bodies, and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the blood into the veins, and doth purifie it, ſeparating the ſharp and evill parts, and ſending it to a certain bladder, which we call the Gall; and when it is ſo full that it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no more, it runneth over, and ſo cauſeth the body to become yellow, and thereupon the Urine is yellow, and is ſo evill, that in ſhort time it dryeth that bodie, ſo that the Liver being diſpenſator both of the good and bad qualities of the humours, it cannot be but through the infirmities of the bodie. Alſo when the Liver is over hot and drie, it cauſeth the Patient to be lean and dry, and with great heat: and when the Liver is troubled with humiditie and cold, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Patient to become full of ſores and ſcabbs, and theſe are the effects that come of the Liver when it is diſtempered. But if thou wilt help it from that indiſpoſition, it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to evacuate the body and ſtomack of ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which thou ſhalt do with our <hi>Soluble Sirrup,</hi> giving it eight or ten daies together cold, and then purge the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack with our <hi>Aromatico</hi> faſting in the morning; that being done, you ſhall uſe remedies that help the Liver, which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe infirmities of the Lungs are of two kindes, that is cold and moiſt, and hot and drie, the which infirmitie is cauſed of evill temperature of the body. You ſhall note, that when the Lungs is infected with cold and moiſt, it will eaſily turn to that kind of <hi>Hectick</hi> that cauſeth the Cough, and to ſpit matter at the mouth. But when it is grieved with heat and drineſſe, it is in danger to turne to a <hi>Tiſſick,</hi> the which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe cauſeth a man to become lean and drie, and keepeth back his breath, and ſo the one with another they are mortall diſeaſes, ſo that there can ſcarce be found any remedie; and therefore I will begin with the firſt kind, and then with the ſecond, and then the third, and then with the fourth and laſt, for the which there is no redemption or hope of life. But for the firſt and ſecond, there are a number of remedies that doe help, the which be theſe. Firſt, give the Patient of the juyce of the Roots of blew Lillies, ℥ ii. with <hi>Mel Roſarum,</hi> ℥. i. in the morning faſting, and that uſe three times, every third day once: That being done, let him uſe our <hi>Elixar vitae</hi> for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or fortie daies together morning and evening; the doſe is <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. ii. at a time, and alſo put therein every time half an ounce of our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and drinke it a little warme, for this is a perfect remedie, with which I have cured an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in my daies. And of all the Medicines that ever I found, I never had any like this, becauſe the juyce of the Lilly-root hath vertue attractive that mundifieth the ſtomack, and the <hi>Elixar vitae</hi> comforteth and reſolveth all Ulcers in the Lungs, and the <hi>Magno liquore</hi> diſſolveth the Catarr, and healeth the ſtomack, for I have proved it a number of times, as is ſaid before. I remember me that in the year of our Lord, 1557. I being in <hi>Rome</hi> cured a young man which was a Painter, that was in the houſe of the Cardinall <hi>de Medici,</hi> the which had his Lungs ulcerated, and did ſpit great quantitie of blood, and had a great Catarr and Cough, and did ſpit alſo matter, in the which there was no hope of life. I cauſed him to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45531:41"/>
uſe the aforeſaid remedies, and ſo in ſhort time he was hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and not onely he, but a great number more at ſundry times.</p>

                     <p>THe Spleen is never ſick but through other diſeaſes, as you may ſee by experience, how that thoſe that have the Fever <hi>Quartane,</hi> for the moſt part have their Spleen alterated and hard, and this proceedeth of evill temperature of the bodie and Liver, that cannot digeſt the humours, and ſo Nature ſendeth them forth in the weakeſt parts that are moſt apt to receive them. So that the Spleen is like a ſpunge, and very apt to receive that humiditie, that Nature cannot diſſolve otherwiſe, and ſo by this reaſon it is moſt apt to be ſick or diſeaſed: therefore if thou wilt cure it, firſt cure the diſeaſe which cauſeth that alteration, for that being once helped, Nature of it ſelf will help the Spleen without any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and therefore ſtrive not to help the Spleen with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Medicines, for it is vain; but look what kinde of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe the Patient is troubled with, and cure that, and then the Spleen will heal well enough.

                     <p>THe cauſes of the retention of Urine are many, among the which, there are three principally above the reſt, and are ſo manifeſt, that every one may underſtand them: and are theſe. Stones, as well great, as gravell, viſcoſity in the Reins and Bladder, and alteration in the pores: And thus through thoſe three accidents, moſt commonly they cannot make water: the which if thou wilt help, it will be ſomewhat hard, becauſe you muſt underſtand the cauſe thereof, the which is not eaſily done of every man: for he that knoweth not the cauſe, can leſſe help the effect, and he that knoweth not the effect, can leſſe help them. And therefore, I ſay, he that will help thoſe that cannot make water, becauſe of the ſtone in the bladder, he muſt ſeringe them to take forth the Urine: but if thou wilt help
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45531:42"/>
thoſe that cannot make water through the gravell, you ſhall give them our <hi>Pillole Aquilone:</hi> and then give them a Flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone made in fine powder, to drink with water of <hi>Saxifrage,</hi> and thou ſhalt ſee thereof miracles.

                     <p>THe retention of Urine which cometh through heat, is that which ingendereth the ſtone and gravell, for through that ſuperfluous heat it ingendereth.

there are many Medicines that may pleaſure them of our invention: As concerning the gravell, there are many things that diſſolve it, of the which I have ſpoken of in divers places: As concerning the remedy of the cauſe, that is eaſie: for by purging the ſtomack and the body, the heat will be diſſolved, and the body left in good temperature.

                     <p>THere are divers kindes of difficulty of Urine, and are alſo cauſed of divers cauſes, as aforeſaid, of the which one is cauſed of a corrupt humour of the French Pox, and this is one of the chiefeſt cauſes that may be in that matter.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45531:44"/>
all the body of thoſe that are troubled therewith. Alſo we may ſee, that thoſe which are infected with that kind of diſeaſe, moſt commonly have Warts, or <hi>Carvoli, Pellaria,</hi> Botches, Scabs, Tumours, paines of the Stomack, in the Armes and Legs, with a number of other more ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that come through that diſeaſe, But when that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity infecteth inwardly, it worketh theſe effects: It bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Emeroides, paines in the Entrals, Fluxes of the body, continuall ſpitting, <hi>Gonorrea,</hi> or running of the Reines, ſuch like effects. All the which cauſe difficulty of Urine, of the which difficulty, there uſeth to ingender the Stone, Gravell, Viſcoſity, Stitch in the ſide, and divers other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs very hurtfull unto the body. The difficulty of Urine may alſo be cauſed of divers other infirmities, as of a rotten Catarre, deſcention of the head, of the evill quality of the Liver, and ſuch like, as by exceſſive cold, or heat of the Reines, but let it be as it will, I know theſe are hard matters to be helped, becauſe it behooveth certain manuall practiſe in that faculty, the which I cannot ſhew in writing: although I have great and high ſecrets for that indiſpoſition, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Phyſick part, the which thou mayeſt find in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of my works.

                     <p>THis infirmity may come of divers and ſundry cauſes. Nevertheleſſe, I will treat of ſome of the principall, and of moſt importance; and alſo will ſhew the true order to help them with eaſe and brevitie. The firſt cauſe aſſigned by me is the Stone in the Bladder, and this is in a manner uncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The ſecond cauſe is, the running of the Reins, the which is taken by companying with women corrupted with the Pox. The third cauſe is, the proper French Pox, the which is that kind that is called <hi>Gonorrea.</hi> The fourth kind is a certain corruption that is called <hi>Stranguria,</hi> the which moveth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to make water. The fifth cauſe is the Gravell: there are alſo other cauſes, as ſcorching in the Yeard, carnoſitie, and ſuch like things, the which I will leave for troubling of the Reader. The firſt cauſe which is the Stone, is helped by two remedies, the one is with cutting and taking it forth of the bladder, the other remedie is written in this book. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for that which is cauſed by the running of the Reins, ſhall be to take three mornings our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> becauſe it reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that heat, and extinguiſheth the burning. The remedie for that which is cauſed of <hi>Gonorrea,</hi> is none other then to cure the principall diſeaſe, and to annoint them with our <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento magno,</hi> and perfume them, and ſo they ſhall remain whole. That which is cauſſed of the Strangurie, is cured by great purging, and by taking oftentimes our <hi>Aromatico.</hi> That which is cauſed of the Gravell, is cured by taking often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our <hi>Electuario Angelica,</hi> and uſing to drinke Wine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled with Cherrie ſtones, and Medler ſtones. That which cometh through carnoſitie, is cured with an Unguent made of oil of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol, Aqua reale,</hi> Oil of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, and new Wax, all Medicines deviſed by us, giving you charge, that before you begin to cure them, to ſeek out the right cauſe from whence it proceedeth, and ſo thou ſhalt help it with brevitie and great eaſe.</p>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, in this place, I mean, ſomething to diſcourſe thereof, becauſe that Chirurgions may not be void of ſuch a noble Secret, to doe them honour in their cure of the like diſeaſe, for there are many troubled with that infirmitie: You ſhall underſtand, that this carnoſitie is an infirmitie whoſe originall dependeth of the corruption of the French-Pox, and to ſhew it plainer, it is an Ulcer in the neck of the bladder where the Urine entreth into the Yeard. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if thou wilt help that infirmitie, cure the principall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and the carnoſitie will heal; but if thou wilt cure them with the Candle, take that Unguent which is written for the carnoſitie in the Chapter of the burning of the Urine; but if thou wilt cure the principall diſeaſe, give him three times, <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lole aquilone,</hi> and then take our <hi>Sirrupo Solutivo,</hi> ten or twelve daies together; that being done, let him take twentie daies the Wine of <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> written hereafter in this Book, and thoſe which underſtand not this Chapter well, let him look over this Book, and he ſhall finde thoſe Medicines with their Uſes.</p>

                     <p>THat Carnoſitie which hindereth the Urine that it cannot come forth, is a certain kinde of matter that is ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the mouth of the bladder as is ſhewed before, the which is like in all points unto the Emeroids, that come in the neck of the Inteſtivall about the Fundament, and becauſe it is a groſſe matter and ulcerated, the Urine paſſeth with great difficultie, and great burning and pain unto thoſe that are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45531:45"/>
troubled therewith, the which inconvenience if thou wilt help, it were neceſſary that the bodie were well purged, and that they keep a diet, and drinke the decoction of <hi>Hypericon,</hi> with a little Honie, and uſe to eat drie meats, and then make certain ſmall long Candles with Wax, and Frankincenſe, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſearing Candles, then make this Unguent. Take red Lead, white Honie, of each an ounce, freſh Butter two ounces, white Wine as much as will ſuffice to incorporate all the aforeſaid together in a liquid form, then boil it on a ſoft fire, and have readie ten or twelve quills freſh pulled out of the wing of a fat Pigeon; and note that when ye take them forth of the wing, that they may be full of blood in the ends, then take one of the quills and ſtir the ſaid Unguent upon the fire continually while it boileth, and when one quill is dried take another, and ſo doe untill the wine be conſumed, then take it from the fire and keep it, and when ye will occupie it, take one of thoſe Candles, and upon the end put the ſaid Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, and put it into the Yeard untill it touch the carnoſity, and this doe from time to time untill the Candle paſſe without pain, and then the Patient ſhall be whole; for this is a great Secret and hath been proved many times.</p>

                     <p>THis Impediment cometh of two principall cauſes, the one is, through heat and moiſture of the bodie, and this is commonly in young children, which commonly doe be piſſe themſelves, becauſe they are by Nature hot and moiſt. The other cauſe is through opening of the Pores where the Urine doth paſſe; the which are ſo ſtretched or opened, that they cannot retain the Urine, becauſe the Urine is a voluntary motion, and a naturall motion together, they are hard to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, becauſe the naturall motion maketh his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie motion; ſo that Nature firſt moveth the man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cometh the motion; for if a man would make water, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45531:46"/>
that Nature doth not move the motion, he cannot piſſe; for ſometime Nature doth not give his naturall motion becauſe of ſome impediment, for when a man cannot hold his water, it is a ſign that Nature hath no retention; and to redreſſe the ſame, it were neceſſarie to reduce Nature into good tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, ſo that it may retain the Urine; the which thing thou ſhalt doe with purging the bodie, and the ſtomack wherein is the matter that cauſeth that retention of Urine. And to purge the bodie you ſhall uſe our Sirrup againſt the melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: And to purge the ſtomack, you ſhall take our <hi>Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio angelica,</hi> and to reſtrain the pores, you ſhall uſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of wild Hyſop, with the powder of <hi>Mastick,</hi> for you ſhall underſtand, that the purging taketh away the cauſe, and the decoction of Hyſop with the Maſtick, doth reſtrain the pores, and ſo by theſe meanes thou ſhalt remedie quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that infirmitie.</p>

                     <p>THere is found a certain bird called <hi>Solone,</hi> of <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> in his Book of Secrets; the which birds are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plenteous in <hi>Rome,</hi> and are called <hi>Palmum bellae,</hi> and in <hi>Lumbardie, Saſſarvoli,</hi> the which in Engliſh I ſuppoſe, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Ring Dove, or Wood-colver, or the Stock Dove, which Birds are ſubject to the Stone, that if you keep them in a Cage, and feed them with ſuch meat as they commonly uſe, being deprived of their medicine, within the ſpace of four or ſix moneths at the moſt, there will ingender a Stone in the belly ſo great, that their meat cannot paſſe through them, and ſo choaketh them, and they die, and that is becauſe the poor Bird cannot goe and help himſelf with that Medicine which Nature hath taught her. For thoſe that are at libertie in the field, flie unto the Sea-ſide, and there they find a certain kind of ſmall ſtone very hard, the which ſtone hath vertue to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the ſtone in the bodie of the Bird, and this Bird knoweth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45531:46"/>
it by the inſtinct of Nature, and eateth great abundance of them, and ſo diſſolveth the ſtone in their bellies, and live a long time after it without any trouble of the Stone. You ſhall underſtand, that this ſtone is unpoſſible to be found in any other place, then in the belly of the ſaid bird, becauſe they are very little, and mans reaſon cannot diſcern them from other Stones, the which being beat in powder, with the flowers of Elders, and Cinnamon, of each a like, and given to drink with broth, in ſhort time it will diſſolve the Stone, and cauſe them to avoid it with their Urine moſt miraculouſly: But if you ask me the reaſon, I know not what I ſhall anſwer, but I hold it to be his proper hidden qualitie and vertue. For truly this I have taught to many, and have ſeen the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thereof ſundrie times, and it cured the moſt part that did uſe it. For truely the vertue of Stones are very great unto thoſe that know them. I ſaw once two Stones in <hi>Rome</hi> of ineſtimable vertue; The one was a round Corall like unto the <hi>Serpentine Purphire,</hi> but therein was much green, and was of that vertue that being laid upon the fleſh of a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it cauſeth them to piſſe great abundance, ſo that it were to be wondred at. The other Stone was of <hi>Diaſper,</hi> but bright and thorough ſhining with certain white veins, and was of ſuch vertue, that being laid on a wound, preſently the blood ſtench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo that there fell not down one drop, The which Stones were in the hand of an old Spaniard, who ſaid, he brought them out of <hi>India,</hi> from <hi>Nova Hiſpania.</hi> I have ſeen alſo divers and ſundry Stones of moſt ſtrange vertues. You ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thoſe Stones of the Bird muſt be gotten in this order. You ſhall get a number of the ſaid Birds, and take the ſtones out of their bellies, and waſh them clean, and keep them to thy uſe. The quantitie is as much as you can hold upon a Sixpence, as well of the Stones as of the other matters: You ſhall drinke the ſaid quantitie ſeven or eight mornings together, and let your Diet be according, and drink good wine, and ſo in ſhort time you ſhall be helped.</p>

For there is no Art in the world, that hath more need of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divers things then this Art. It is alſo neceſſary to the knowledge of naturall things belonging to Chirurgery, to have skill in Husbandry. It is alſo neceſſary to underſtand the Art of Painting, whereby you may ſet broken bones in their places, and to joyn or cloſe wounds well. It were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alſo to have skill in the Art of Joyning, whereby he may make Inſtruments for broken bones in the Armes, or Legs, or Hands, or other parts. It would be alſo neceſſary to have the Art of a Smith, whereby he may make his Inſtruments. It is cheifly needfull to be expert in the Art of an Apothecary, to make his Unguents. And laſt of all, it is moſt neceſſary to know the Art of <hi>Alchimie,</hi> whereby he may diſtill his Oyles and Waters appertaining unto Chirurgery. Alſo it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have a good judgement, and to help in all cauſes of Chirurgery, and to have a light hand in working. And when the Chirurgian is expert in all the aforeſaid things, he may help without any ſuſpition of any thing.

                     <p>THeſe Impoſtumes are cauſed of groſſe and viſcous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, the which Nature cannot digeſt by any other part, and theſe commonly are called <hi>Topinaxia,</hi> becauſe they are like to a Molehill. And although this ſeem to be a great matter, yet it cauſeth little pain, and may be holpen with eaſe. Firſt purge the bodie with Soluble Medicines, and then lay on this plaiſter untill it be ripe. Take grated bread, leaven of bread, Cow Milk, Oil of Lillies, <hi>ana,</hi> and boil them together and lay it on; for this hath vertue attractive and putrifactive, by meanes whereof it will bring it quickly to maturation; and when it is ripe, open it with a launce, and dreſſe it the firſt time with the white of an Egg and Salt beaten together with a tent, and lay on a ſtopine wet with the white of an Egg, the which thou ſhalt let lie at the leaſt four and twentie hours, and then dreſſe it with digeſtive untill it be incarnated, and then lay thereon a plaiſter of <hi>Dia aquilone magno di Meſue,</hi> and ſo thou ſhalt help them quickly.</p>

                     <p>VLcers are of divers and ſundry kinds, and are ingendered of many cauſes, as hereafter I will ſhew. But firſt I will write of thoſe kinds of Ulcers that are cauſed of Wounds. You ſhall underſtand, that wounds in what part of the body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, being impoſthumated or cancrenated, they change their names, and are no more called wounds, although their originall was a wound. For when it is cancrenated, it is called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera corroſiva,</hi> becauſe it goeth eating and creeping on the fleſh: but when the wound is impoſthumated and full of matter, it is called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera putrida,</hi> that is putrified, and it is becauſe it is filthy and ſtinketh. But when it is neither can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crenated, nor yet apoſthumated, but that through ſome evill diſpoſition the wound is cloſed, and that there cometh in it evill qualities without alteration, then is it called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida,</hi> becauſe therein is evill qualitie, and it appeareth but little, but it is evill to heal. There be other ſorts of Ulcers alſo, which are cauſed of divers and ſundry kinds of Tumours: and the moſt evill and miſcheivious are thoſe that are of Tumours cauſed of the Pox: for unto thoſe there runne abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of evill humours that augment the Ulcer, and they be the worſt ſort, for they cannot be healed by themſelves, except the body be well purged and evacuated of all the humours that are offenſive. There is another kinde of Ulcer that cometh of an Impoſthume as well hot as cold, and thoſe are more gentle and eaſie to be helped, if you know the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that are apt to help and diſſolve thoſe kinds of Ulcers. Theſe are the three kinds of Ulcers that commonly happen unto men and women through divers cauſes, as before is ſaid, ſo that theſe are the principall cauſes of thoſe maligne Ulcers.</p>

And firſt I will write of the corroſive Ulcers, as of a wound cancrenated, of <hi>Mal di formica,</hi> and of other ſorts of Ulcers that goe creeping upon the fleſh. The cure of theſe kinds of Ulcers is, to apply quickly our <hi>Cauſtick</hi> to mortifie the evill, which thou ſhalt doe thus. Wet a little Bumbaſt in our <hi>Cauſtick,</hi> and therewith waſh all the ſore, and then leave it ſo open four and twenty houres without binding it faſt, and when four and twenty houres are paſt, waſh the ſore with ſtrong Vineger, and water of a like quantity, with charge that there remain none of the <hi>Cauſtick</hi> in the ſore: then lay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Butter waſhed with a Colewort leafe, untill the asker or dead fleſh fall: then take our <hi>Cerot Magiſtrale,</hi> with a little <hi>Precipitate</hi> ſtrewed thereon, and then annoint it with <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and lay it upon the ſore: for this <hi>Cerot</hi> helpeth all manner of coroſive Ulcers without any other help, and every plaiſter will ſerve three or four dayes, taking them off every four and twenty houres, and making them clean, and then lay them on again. And as for the filthy Ulcer that I have ſhewed of in this Chapter, you ſhall dreſſe it onely with our <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento magno,</hi> the which, without any other help, will heal them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But you muſt every four dayes touch them with <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> drawn from <hi>Precipitate,</hi> which water draweth forth the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive matter, and leaveth it purified and clean. And in all other ſorts of Ulcers, our <hi>Balm artificiall,</hi> our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> Oil of Wax, and Turpentine, the black Cerot of <hi>Godfredo di me di,</hi> our <hi>Cerot Magiſtrale</hi> with <hi>Precipitate,</hi> are able to help, be they never ſo evill.

                     <p>THeſe Ulcers in the Legs are of two kinds, that is, filthy, and corroſive. The filthy Ulcers are cauſed of cold and moiſt humours: The corroſive are cauſed of humours hot and dry: and theſe are thoſe Ulcers that goe creeping in the fleſh, healing in one place, and breaking out in another. The fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Ulcer is ſtinking and full of matter, and cauſeth little pain, and their cure is with our <hi>Balm artificiall,</hi> which hath vertue to penetrate, digeſt, mundifie, and incarnate, and heal, when that the body is firſt well purged: but thoſe that are cauſed of heat and drineſſe, you ſhall cure with the remedy

The Simple wounds are thoſe, where the fleſh is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended. The Compound are thoſe, where there is offence of fleſh, ſinews, veins, and bones, and the cure of either of them is in three manners. The firſt is a cure pertaining to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45531:57"/>
Nature and not to Art, and that is it which Dogs and other Animals doe uſe, who being wounded, uſe no other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine then to keep the wound clean with their proper tongues, and keep a Diet, and the reſt is left unto Nature which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth well without pains of Medicine, and this is the firſt. The ſecond is that which is called <hi>Canonico,</hi> in which there be four operations. The firſt is, Digeſtion. The ſecond, Mundification. The third, Incarnation. The fourth, Siccatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The third order is of our invention, and is done in this order, that is; Whenſoever a man hath a wound either ſimple or compound, the firſt thing that is to be done therein is, to joyn the parts cloſe together, and ſtitch them, and dreſs them with divers ſorts of drying Medicines, as I will ſhew thee hereafter in the cure of Wounds, in ſundry parts of the bodie.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> What Medicines are fitteſt to heal Wounds outwardly with eaſe, and in ſhort time.</head>
                     <p>HAving declared alreadie what wounds are outwardly, it is neceſſary alſo to ſhew the true order to cure them with as much eaſe, and brevitie, as is poſſible to be done: And firſt, I will begin with ſimple wounds that are onely in the fleſh, without offence of vein, ſinew or bone. Although theſe ſorts of wounds are not to be helped with artifice, but onely to joyn the parts together, and if it be neceſſary alſo to ſtitch them, and ſo leave it unto Nature, the which in ſhort time will heal it, nevertheleſſe if thou wilt help it with arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the faſter, you ſhall annoint it once a day with oile of Frankincenſe made by Diſtillation, as is ſhewed in this Book. But thoſe wounds where there are veins cut, have need to be ſuccoured preſently with ingenious artifice, and perfect Remedies to eaſe and heal them with the moſt ſpeed that can be, becauſe the veins may joyn together, without greater offence of the wound, and this Miſterie thou ſhalt doe in this order: The firſt is to joyn the wound together quickly, and ſtitch
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45531:57"/>
it cloſe as they uſe to ſow bags, and not to leave great wide ſtitches as they moſt commonly do; that being done, dreſſe it upon the wound with our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> wetting therein a cloth, and laying it on as hot as you may ſuffer it, then ſtrew thereupon our ſecret powder, and alſo round about it, for that ſubtiliateth the matter that runneth to the wound, and taketh it forth with great eaſe, and without pain of the wound, and therefore this is one of the moſt ſafeſt Remedies in that caſe, that Nature with Art can make, and hath been proved an infinite of times by me, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies have had goodly experiences thereof. Alſo underſtand that theſe wounds, where the bones and ſinews are cut, have need of great artifice, for they are of great importance. But when there is offence onely of the ſinews, you ſhall ſtitch them preſently, and doe as I have ſaid before of veins that were cut, but dreſſe them not with <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> but in ſtead of that take <hi>Oleum Benedictum,</hi> and oil of Frankincenſe, of each alike, becauſe theſe Oiles doe comfort marvellouſly thoſe ſinews that are cut. If it chance ſo, that a ſinew had a puncture, or cut half away, in that caſe it is neceſſarie to cut it overthwart, leſt it ſhould bring a Spaſm in the wound. But in caſe afterward that the bone be offended, and that there be ſome part to come forth, it were neceſſary to leave the wound open untill the bone be come forth, and then incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it; and this thou ſhalt doe with our <hi>Balſamo Artificiato,</hi> and lay thereon the Cerot of <hi>Godfredo di medi,</hi> the which hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth with great ſpeed. And this is the order wherewith thou mayeſt help all thoſe ſorts of wounds before named, and the defenſive to uſe in theſe wounds is this. Take perfect <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> made of good Wine, and put therein <hi>Hypericon, Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folly, Viticella, Betonie,</hi> and with that Infuſion wet clothes, and lay them for a defenſive round about the wound, and thou ſhalt have good ſucceſſe. Wounds in the head are hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the order, as thoſe in whom the Sinews are offended. There are divers other ſorts of wounds, which may be healed with the aforeſaid remedies, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>

                     <p>VVOunds in the head, where there is offence of the brain, are mortall: and there is no Phyſician that will take them in cure, but he counteth them dead men without any hope. But I by the grace of God and gift of Nature, have found the order to cure and heal them in ſhort time. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that when one was wounded in the head in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Citie of <hi>Naples,</hi> yea, although the brain were not hurt, but that the skin were cut unto the bone, they counted him mortall, but I dreſſed them, and cloſed their wounds, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in ſhort ſpace, ſo that they wondred thereat; and that order I uſed for the ſpace of ſeven yeers that I tarried there, and cauſed them to walk in the ſtreets, as it is well known unto all thoſe that dwell there. And among a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other, I cured a Portingall that was called, <hi>Il Seignior Diego di mena,</hi> of whom I took away all the bone of the forehead, and every day he came to my lodging to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which I did with great ſpeed, ſo that it cauſed every one to marvell thereat. Afterward I went to <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Pope Paulus</hi> the iiii. Carafa, and alwaies I cured in the ſame order, and did miracles, of which I call to teſtimonie the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And among the reſt, I cured a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>M. Aleſſandor</hi> (I cannot remember his Sirname) who was wounded in divers places, and I cured him quickly. After that I cured, and that in ſhort time, a young man that was in manner cut in pieces, and of that <hi>M. Jacomo da Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia, M. Aleſſandro da Civita, M. Daltilo Hebraeo,</hi> all learned Doctors can teſtifie, for they were preſent. And ſuch like cures I have alwaies done in <hi>Venice:</hi> But among the reſt I will not leave to write of a great chance, the which is true, and is thus: There is in <hi>Venice</hi> a rare Poet and Orator and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographer, well known unto the world called <hi>M. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigio Antanagi,</hi> who through his evill deſtinie was wounded in the head, ſo that it penetrated the fleſh and the bone, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred half a finger breadth into the brain, and there that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45531:58"/>
man fell to the ground as a dead man, and he lifted himſelf up to riſe, but he could not, but fell down again, and there came a dimneſs over his eyes, with a vomiting and and a Fever, and the blood would not ſtint, and he lay in extream pains, which were all mortall ſigns: then I being called unto that cure, becauſe he and I were of great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie, and preſently I ſhut the wound, and put therein our <hi>Aqua balſami,</hi> and I annointed all his head with our <hi>Balſamo artificiato;</hi> that being done, preſently the blood ſtenched, and the pain went away, and the night after he took his reſt, and in the morning the Fever was alſo gone: After that, I dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> wetting clothes therein, and upon the cloth I ſtrewed the powder of <hi>Hypericon:</hi> And this Medicine I uſed eight daies, in the which time he came forth of his bed; and ſhortly after he was perfectly whole, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſix moneths were paſt, it was ſo ſiccatrized, that no man could perceive any wound. And of this I have to teſtimony <hi>Venice, Rome, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbine, Caglie,</hi> and all <hi>Italy.</hi> To conclude this Chapter, I ſay, that wite the aforeſaid order, thou mayeſt cure any ſuch ſort of wound.</p>

                     <p>VVOunds in the Head, with Fracture of the bone, of the common Phyſicians and Chirurgians, are counted dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile to be healed, becauſe thereunto belongeth great art or cunning, for they open the fleſh and raſpe the bone, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, of which here I account it ſuperfluous to treat of, becauſe that many be helped without them. For alwayes when the Phyſitian or Chirurgian, doth defend the wound from alteration and corruption, nature it ſelf will work very well, and heal it without any other aid; but with our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines they may be helped with much more ſpeed, becauſe they let the alteration, and defendeth them from Putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mittigateth the pain, and the order to cure thoſe kinds of wounds is thus: The firſt thing that is to be done in thoſe wounds is, to joyn the parts cloſe together, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45531:59"/>
dreſſe them upon the wound with our <hi>Oleum Benedictum,</hi> and upon the oile lay clothes wet in our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> as hot as you may ſuffer it, and ſo with theſe Remedies thou ſhalt help them quickly, becauſe our <hi>Oleum Benedictum</hi> taketh away the pains, and keepeth it from putrifaction, and repercuſſeth: Our <hi>Magno liquore</hi> digeſteth, mundifieth, and incarnateth, and healeth. And therefore this is the beſt Medicine that can be uſed in theſe kinds of wounds. For hereof I have had an infinite of experiences, the which have been counted Miracles, and therefore I have let the world to underſtand thereof, that they may help themſelves, if occaſion ſhall ſerve; therefore he that will follow this our order in curing, ſhall work Miracles on the earth.</p>

For, they ſay, that Contuſions muſt be brought to putrefaction, and turned into matter: which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I doe not allow: For by me thoſe Contuſions or bruiſes, are very eaſie to be diſſolved without maturation: And that I doe with our <hi>Oleo benedicto,</hi> and <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> as much of the one as of the other mixt together, and made very hot as you may ſuffer it, and then wet clothes therein twice a day, and in three or four dayes at the moſt, they ſhall be reſolved: and this it doth, becauſe this remedy aſſubtiliateth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and openeth the pores, and draweth forth the matter that is runne unto the place offended, and ſo by thoſe means they ſhall be helped. With this remedy I have cured hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds when I was in the warres in <hi>Africa,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1551. when the ſaid City was taken and deſtroyed by the Camp of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour.</p>

                     <p>VVOunds in the neck are very perilous, and hard to be cured, and long before they will heal: and this cometh becauſe in it are all the ligaments of the head, as bones, ſinewes, veins, fleſh, and skin, all inſtruments that hold the head and the body together, without the which a man cannot live: and therefore thoſe wounds are ſo perilous to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſeeing thereunto runneth ſo great quantity of humours, that they will not ſuffer the wound to be healed. The true way therefore to help theſe wounds, is to ſtitch them well in his place, and dreſſe it upon the wound with clothes wet in <hi>Oleum benedictum</hi> one part, and <hi>Magno liquore</hi> three parts mixt together, as hot as you can ſuffer it: and upon the cloth lay the powder of <hi>Mille folie:</hi> and this thou ſhalt doe once in four and twenty houres, and ſo thou ſhalt help them quickly; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you great charge, that you change not your Medicine, for this mundifieth, incarnateth, and healeth the wound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further help: For I have proved it an infinite of times.</p>

And the cauſe is, for that the parts of the breaſt are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Skin, Cartilages, Sinewes, Fleſh, and Bones. So that it cannot be but troubleſome and perilous. For where the ſinew parts be hurt, there ariſeth ever great pain, which for the moſt part bringeth Fevers, and other accidents, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is evill to cure. The cure of them is with our <hi>Balſamo</hi> and <hi>Quinta eſſentia.</hi> For the one taketh away the pain, and the other keepeth from alteration. But when they are peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing into the body, they are moſt dangerous, becauſe the Chirurgian cannot tell certainly what part within the body

is offended or hurt. Either the Liver, or the Lungs, or the Milt, or any other particulars. Moreover, there is another matter which maketh it dangerous, which is, when they are penetrating, the matter that proceedeth from the Wound falleth into the body, as well as out. And remaining in the body cauſeth putrifaction, then Fevers follow, and commonly death. Wherefore in this caſe, cauſe the Patient to vomit, and to keep ſlender diet, becauſe the humour ſhould not alter to the dammage of the wounded.

                     <p>VVOunds in the belly are doubtfull, and very uncertain to cure, becauſe it is unpoſſible to know how they are, or of what importance they be: for although yee may ſee the Orifice where the Weapon went in, yet yee cannot know what offence it hath done in the interiour parts, and therefore they are bard to be helped, and worſe to judge of, and for that cauſe I will not ſtand long in reaſoning thereof: for I have determined not to ſpeak of things uncertain and doubtfull, but onely of things that may be proved by reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And becauſe thoſe wounds be uncertain, I will write nothing of them, for fear of hiding the truth: but I will write of thoſe in the reines or back, and firſt I will ſhew what the reines are, becauſe every one may comprehend my reaſon. It is to be underſtood, that our bodies are made all of ſenſible things: as inwardly, the Stomack, the Heart, the Liver, the Lungs, the Belly, the Milt, the Guts, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other things which are not common, or known to all men, as thoſe which I have ſpoken of. The reſt of the man is made of Cartilagines, of Veines, of Muskles, of Fleſh,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45531:61"/>
of Skin, and other particulars of ſmall importance to know, becauſe the wiſe, learned, and reverend, my Lord <hi>Canan Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rareſe,</hi> hath writ thereof better then ever any in the world hath done, and therefore if you beleeve not me, beleeve his writing ſet forth in print. But to return to our purpoſe, I ſay, that God hath compounded the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n naturally of all theſe things that I have ſpoken of: and becauſe they are ſoft and tender, he hath placed the bones in the middeſt of them to ſtrengthen them, and to keep them ſtreight, &amp;c. And from the ſhoulder to the thigh, he hath made a great pillar, of many peices of bones joyned together: On the one part whereof groweth the ribs, which holdeth the fleſh, skin, and other particulars farre from the interiours: and upon that bone on the outward ſide, are the magiſtrall ſinewes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the head, and bind all the back together, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down unto the feet. Therefore (this being true that I have ſaid) wounds in the head are very dangerous in all his actions, and their cure very hard, becauſe all thoſe ſences that give nouriſhment, paſſe by the reines downward to the lower parts: and moſt commonly when a man is wounded in thoſe places, he remaineth lame on the leg that is on that part, and being, as it is, hard and dangerous, the cure of it, according to the Canons of the Ancients, is alſo perilous; becauſe in thoſe places where ſo many particulars doe meet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, there ought not in any wiſe to be putrifaction, or digeſtion, but to preſerve: You may not bring it to maturation, but to keep it from it; you may not incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but with ſpeed heal it up: and ſo in this order the cure ſhall ſucceed well, and without danger. And this I will ſhew unto every one, becauſe he ſhall profit by our doctrine to the glory of God, and health of the wounded. When one is wounded in thoſe parts, I counſell that the Chirurgian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhall cloſe the wound with all his diligence, putting thereupon of our <hi>Quinta eſſentia,</hi> and inſtead of a defenſive our <hi>Balſamo,</hi> and upon the wound lay a cloth wet in our <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and upon the cloth ſtrew our ſecret powder for wounds, and following this order, he ſhall be reputed for an excellent Chirurgian above all other: and this is the meer

                     <p>VVOunds in the Legs are in manner of the ſame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie as thoſe in the armes, becauſe the Legs are of their proper qualitie and Nature compounded of the like ſubſtance that the Armes are, that is, skin, fleſh, muskles, veins, ſinews, and bones. And theſe when they are offended, or wounded, are very perilous, becauſe unto them runneth great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of humours. And in the Legs are certain deadly places as a man may ſay: As the hinder part of the Caulf of the Leg: And the middle of the inner ſide of the thigh: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and the foot are all places troubleſome and curious to heal, when they are wounded. And therefore to heal them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the Ancients, it were great trouble to the Chirurgian, and pittie to ſee the pain of the Patient.

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that all the Medicines, wherein our <hi>Petra Philoſophale</hi> is put, as ſoon as they are come into the ſtomack, it draweth unto it all the evill humours of the ſtomack, and alſo of the

his Elements are ſeparated out of that Gum, the Phyſician may work ſtrange things therewith, againſt moſt part of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities that happen unto mans bodie, if he apply them where they are convenient: For the water being drunke help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth winde in the ſtomack: Alſo it helpeth the white Skall, and all ſuch like ſcabs, if ye waſh them therewith morning and evening.

oyle, both hot materials, as for experience: Take <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire</hi> and lay it by the fire, or ſet it nigh a candle, and thou ſhalt perceive, that aſſoon as it feeleth the heat, it will flie into the fire and burn fiercely; and the like will the Oyle do; for if you wet a cloth therein and hold it over the fire, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it will burn, which are manifeſt ſigns that they be both hot, becuſe they are friends unto the fire; whereas if they were cold and moiſt, the fire would not burn them with ſuch force. As for example, take water, earth, ſtones, and mettals that are cold and moiſt, and lay them on the fire, and you ſhall ſee that the flame of a candle ſhall not be able to kindle the fire with ſuch eaſe as it doth with the <hi>Camphire</hi> and oyle. So that you may ſee that <hi>Camphire</hi> and Oyle are hot and friends unto the fire which is moſt hot, and earth, ſtones, and mettalls, are moiſt and cold, and are enemies unto the fire, and therefore I conclude, that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento Camphorato</hi> is very hot, and cannot by any meanes cool hot Ulcers. Alſo <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum Apoſtolorum</hi> is a compoſition in which there is put <hi>Verdigriece,</hi> a materiall which is moſt enemie unto the ſore, for laying it thereto cauſeth great pain, as you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of thoſe that have proved it, and in my judgement this is no Unguent to be laid on a ſore, becauſe they cannot ſuffer it, neither is it poſſible to heal the ſore with that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, for that it corrodeth the fleſh and will not let it heal. Alſo <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento de minio</hi> is a mixture not very profitable for Ulcers, becauſe it is too much drying; for applying it unto a ſore that is not mundified, it drieth it in <hi>Superficie,</hi> ſo that if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſend humours unto thoſe parts, and they find no exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or vent by reaſon of that drying, it will cauſe the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of abundance of humours, and be a means of greater miſchief: But if the ſore be well mundified and cleanſed, you ſhall have little need of that Unguent, becauſe Nature will doe it alone without any other help, ſo that this Unguent is of ſmall profit to be uſed of any. But to the contrary, there are many ſorts of Unguents which are moſt neceſſary to dreſſe ſores, as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento di Raſino,</hi> which by his Nature is friendly to the ſore, becauſe it mundifieth and healeth, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature that it may work with greater ſpeed. The <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilone
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45531:80"/>
commune</hi> is alſo an Unguent very profitable to mundi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie or purge ſores, and likewiſe to ſiccatrize them. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent of Litarge is refriſcative and drying, and healeth ſcabs, and cooleth the heat of the fleſh alterated. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguento Roſato</hi> doth mittigate the pains of foul Scabs.

And in a manner all poiſons work one effect, and there are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe Poiſons, of which I would ſhew their qualities, but that I fear I ſhould cauſe ſuch as are ignorant to know them, and therefore I leave them.

things being in a man killeth him out of hand; and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarieſt cure in that matter of poyſon is this.

But when the hair doth fall through the other cauſe, yee muſt uſe forcible Medicines to cauſe it to come again, and that thou ſhalt doe with this Cerot. Take Turpentine, Ship-pitch, Roſin of the Pine tree, and new Wax, and make thereof a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45531:82"/>
Cerot, the which ſpread upon a cloth, and ſtrew thereon <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi> in powder, then lay it upon the head, and there let it remain five dayes without moving it, and when yee take it away, take <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and our <hi>Oleum Philoſophorum,</hi> of each alike, and therewith annoint the head once a day very hot.

and then mix it with that which yee diſtilled by a filter, and give it a little walme or two, but not too much, then when it is boyled, before it be cold, put therein the ſaid water that yee diſtilled in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and aromatiſe it with ſix graines of Musk, and ℈. i. of Cloves, and another of Saffron, and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. ſs. of Cinamon, and ℥. iii. of Roſewater, and then keep it in a glaſſe cloſe ſtopped, and it will preſerve a long time: The doſe of this Sirrup is from ℥. i. to ℥. ii. and no more.

                     <p>Take Ginger, Cinnamon, of each one pound, beat them in powder, and infuſe it in half a pound of Roſewater, and there let it remain four or five daies, and then put thereon ℥. iiii. of the water of a Herb called <hi>Mortella,</hi> in the Italian tongue, and ſix pound of the beſt white wine, and diſtill them altogether untill all the ſubſtance be come forth; then take as much white Honey as the matter purified weigheth, and while it is yet hot on the fire, put therein the ſaid Water which

                     <p>Take <hi>Lignum Sanctum</hi> raſped ℥. vi. the Bark of the ſame ℥. iiii. and lay it to infuſe in twelve pound of good white wine, with one pound of white honey, then diſtill it untill ye have received three pound, then take it from the fire, and keep the water by it ſelf; then take that which remained in the glaſſe, and diſtill it by a filter untill it be clear, then put thereto the water that ye diſtilled away, and for every pound of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter put thereunto ℥. iii. of Julep ſimple, and mix them well together, and keep it in a Bottle of glaſſe well ſtopped, for this is marvellous in the cure where Sweatings is needfull: For if ye give five or ſixe ounces of this, as hot as he may ſuffer it, and cover him in the bed, he ſhall ſweat marvellouſly, the which ſweating reſolveth cold tumours, pains, and divers other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions, that are to be reſolved by ſweat.

                     <p>THe Gout is a putrified and rotten diſeaſe, as I have written of in divers places, and the cure thereof is hard, becauſe it were needfull to help many inconveniences before yee come to the cure.

                     <p>THis hearb is well known to moſt men, and hath great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue againſt old greifs, and opilations, and all indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that come through diſtemperment of humours, becauſe it evacuateth the body, cleanſeth the head, and purgeth the bloud: and the order to make it is thus.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pollipodie</hi> two ounces, Sene one ounce, <hi>Lignum Aloes</hi> half an ounce, mix theſe well together in a ſtone morter, then take white Wine as much as yee will, and for every pound of Wine put thereto ℥. i. of that mixture, and ſo let it ſtand four and twenty hours, and then drink it, for it will purge without any pain, thoſe that have any indiſpoſition of the ſtomack, weakneſſe of the legs, and faintneſſe of the body, and ſuch like. For yee ſhall underſtand, the <hi>Pollipodie</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

Flegm, and the Sene purgeth Choller, as by the viſcoſity is known: The <hi>Lignum Aloes</hi> preſerveth nature, ſo that by the ingredients yee may know the vertue of this compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yee ſhall underſtand, that this root would be gathered when the Sunne is afarre off; and that the cold time of the year doth begin to draw on, for then they are of moſt force.</p>

                     <p>TAke common Oil, the which is made of the Olive, two pound, Frankincenſe one pound, Turpentine one pound, diſtill them together in a Retort two dayes long, then ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the oyle from the water, and keep each alone, then take forth the Feſſes out of the Retort, the which is a miracle of Nature, becauſe it ſerveth againſt all Infirmities, where it is applyed. It helpeth broaken bones wonderfully, and theſe ſecrets I have found out by experience. There is alſo drawn out of the wood a liquour by diſcention, the which is black of colour, and is of marvellous vertue againſt paines. A little of this Oil being mixed with Oil of Sulphur, helpeth all putrified and corroſive Ulcers that are cauſed of putrifaction of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. The Lye made of the Aſhes of Olives, preſerveth the beard and hair in their naturall colour, if yee waſh the head often therewith. Of this Oil I have made a great diſcourſe in my Chirurgery.</p>

And among all other things that I ſaw of this Ciperous; there was a Merchant called <hi>Nicolo Carbolo,</hi> the which was of the age of thirty yeares, and was troubled with a kind of ſcab like a Leper, and had carried it long, the which I cauſed to make this Oil, and he did not onely annoint him therewith, but alſo drunk thereof every morning ℥. ſs. with wine, ſo that in ſhort time he became ſo whole and ſound, that it was to be wondered at.</p>

                     <p>THis Hearb <hi>Millefolie,</hi> is well known unto moſt men; and of many is little eſteemed, becauſe it groweth ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt us. This Hearb being green, is a miraculous and divine remedie, to help any ſorts of freſh and bleeding wounds, if ye ſtamp a handfull thereof, and lay it thereupon the lips being cloſe joyned together, within the ſpace of four and twentie-houres it ſhall be perfectly whole. If yee drinke three ounces of the juyce of this Hearb with new Milk, morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, it will help <hi>Gonorrea</hi> in ſhort time. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an excellent remedie for thoſe that have their Liver and Lungs ulcerated, for this I have proved divers and ſundry times in Goats, the which are troubled with a certain infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, the which is called <hi>Biſſole</hi> of the Goat-keepers, for they are certain Impoſthumes that doe ingender in the Liver and the Lungs, and cauſeth them to die. I then ſeeing that in the interiour parts of the Goats, made this experience, I took <hi>Millefolie</hi> made in powder, and gave it unto the Goats with Salt, and for the moſt part they were helped; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I cured a number of men and women of that diſeaſe, for of that infirmity there die a great number in the world. And with the ſaid order aforeſaid, thou mayeſt ſave a number, but it muſt be mixed with <hi>Sal artificiato Leonardo.</hi> Thoſe that are <hi>Ettici</hi> and <hi>Teſici</hi> die commonly through Impoſthumes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45531:95"/>
and Ulcers that are cauſed in the Liver, for of this I have ſeen above an hundred. For after they were dead, I have cauſed them to be opened to ſee the experience. You ſhall underſtand, that this Hearb <hi>Millefolie</hi> hath a great propertie to heal thoſe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. And therefore the Chirurgian that underſtandeth not Phyſick, can ill help thoſe Ulcers inwardly, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply his Unguents and Plaiſters, as he doth outwardly. And thoſe kind of Ulcers cannot be known, but of thoſe which have ſeen them, and have ſeen the ſucceſſe of their diſeaſes, and therefore I may well diſcourſe thereof, becauſe of them have paſſed a great number through my hands, and I have ſeen them with mine eyes. So that I conclude, that all which I have ſaid is two things, the one is, to ſee the thing in fact, the other, to have approved Medicines to help them. A moſt excellent compoſition of this Hearb, the which helpeth wounds in very ſhort time.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. LXXIX.</hi> A great ſecret of a kind of Betonie.</head>
                     <p>THere is found in the field a certain kind of Betonie, the which is the length of an arm or more, and as big in the ſtalk as a Gooſe quill, and it is four ſquare, and the leaf is much like unto the Oaken leafe, and his flour is much like the colour of a Violet, and his ſeed is black, and much lik unto the grains of Gunpowder, and this hearb in <hi>Lumbardie</hi> is called <hi>Betonica,</hi> and in the Realm of <hi>Naples</hi> it is called <hi>Centra galla,</hi> and of this hearb I have ſeen great vertues and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and eſpecially when it beginneth to flour untill it be ſeeded: for if yee diſtill it with ſweet Wine, and receive thereof onely the fourth part, it will reſtore the ſight unto thoſe that are almoſt blind: It comforteth a weak ſtomack very much, if yee drink thereof every morning three or four drachms. The Feſſes which remain in the glaſſe being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Hony and a little <hi>Zedoaria,</hi> helpeth women that are troubled with the Mother, if they drink thereof every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ℥. viii. warm. This hearb being bruieſd with Wine and Salt, and laid upon a freſh wound every three dayes once, helpeth the ſame with ſpeed: Alſo if yee put one of his ſeeds into the eyes, and there let it remain ſo long as yee may ſuffer it, it will clear the ſight marvellouſly, for it hath been proved many times. It helpeth thoſe kind of Scabs the which are moſt evill to be helped, being mixed in this order.</p>
                     <p>Take the juyce of this hearb, although it be ſomewhat drie and hard to get forth, and for every ounce of that juyce, put thereunto ℥. iiii. of the Oil of Frankincenſe that cometh forth laſt in the diſtillation, and boil them a little together untill it begin to fume, then take it from the fire and ſtrain it through a cloth, and when yee goe to bed annoint all the ſcabs therewith cold, and thou ſhalt ſee a moſt ſtrange cure, never written of before by any man, the which I have proved divers and ſundry times, and is a ſecret to be uſed on noble perſonages, becauſe it doth his effect without letting of bloud, and purging, moſt wonderfull to behold: So that it is to be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45531:98"/>
accounted rather a divine Medicine then humane; for truly I have done more cures with this hearb then with any other that ever I uſed.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt I will ſpeak of Wine and his qualities. You ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that Wine is a liquour the which changeth into divers kinds differing from his own nature: And firſt it changeth into Vineger of it ſelf without any artifice, the which can never be turned into Wine again. Alſo they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Wine <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> the which being ſeparated can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be turned into Wine again. Alſo Wine maketh, by ſetling it ſelf, a certain ſtone called Tartar, the which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be turned into Wine again, nor yet into Vineger. And thus when the workman doth tranſmute or change it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be turned again into his firſt quality. Wine is very apt to corrupt, and to change into other kinds, but after that it changeth or tranſmuteth, it is uncorruptible: for when it is turned into Vineger, it is apt to conſerve all things. Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Animall that is put therein, but not the Minerals, for by nature it is enemy unto them. There is alſo ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Wine <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> the which is conſervatrix of all Medicines; for when it is circulated and made into a <hi>Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence</hi> it becometh celeſtiall, as I have ſhewed in my other books, and therewith thou mayeſt help many infirmities, becauſe it mittigateth all pains, and diſſolveth in a manner all infirmities, and eſpecially when it is compounded in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Take of that <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> four parts, Oil of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Vitrioll</hi> of each one part, Julep of Violets ſixty parts: Mix them all together, and it will be of ſuch vertue, that if yee give <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. i. thereof to drink to one that lay at the point of death, it would recover him, becauſe it breaketh choller, preſerveth the ſtomack, cauſeth an appetite, and helpeth any ſort of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and preſerveth both men and women in luſty ſtate, if they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45531:98"/>
uſe it oftentimes; for theſe experiences I have ſeen divers times. Alſo of the Tartar yee may may make Oyle, the which is of marvellous vertue, both in Phyſick, Chirurgerie, and Alchimie. There is alſo drawn forth of Tartar, his ſpirit and oyle in this order, as <hi>Andernacus</hi> writeth, the which is moſt profitable againſt ſundry infirmities, and the order to make it is thus.</p>
                     <p>Take white Tartar and beat it to powder four pound, and put it into a ſtone pot or glaſſe well luted, and ſet it in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to diſtill with a great Receiver cloſe luted, leaſt all the fumes come forth or break the glaſſe, then give it firſt a ſmall fire, and ſo increaſe it as though thou wouldeſt draw a ſtrong water, and ſo continue it untill there come forth no more ſpirits, then let it wax cold, and take forth the liquor, and put it into an upright glaſſe with his head and receiver, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill away the water in <hi>Balneo,</hi> then take that oyle which is in the bottome, and diſtill it in Sand or Aſhes, and there will come forth at the firſt a yellowiſh oyle, and ſo by little and little it will change colour, and become blacker and blacker, and thick like unto a Balme, or a Sirrup. You ſhall underſtand, that the firſt Liquor ſeparated in <hi>Balneo,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Liquor fecularum vini,</hi> or <hi>Spiritus Tartari,</hi> the oyle which yee rectified in Sand, is called <hi>Oleum fecularum vini, ſive Mumia fecularum vini</hi> the which is moſt effectuall and profitable in curing all running Ulcers that goeth creeping upon the fleſh, and eſpecially thoſe that come <hi>Ex lue venerea,</hi> for this <hi>Mumia</hi> doth ſo cure thoſe malign Ulcers, that their malice can hurt no more, but ſhall be quite extincted: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunke with wine, it doth break and expell the Stone in the Reins and Bladder, it provoketh Urine and purgeth Ulcers. Furthermore, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. i. of the liquor or ſpirit of Tartar, being drunke with water of Fumitorie or <hi>Hirundinariae</hi> or ſuch like, as is moſt convenient for <hi>Puſtulas gallicas ex anthemate erici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas,</hi> the Dropſie, Water betwixt the skin and the fleſh, Fevers, <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> and all obſtructions of thoſe parts; it will work all thoſe effects more effectuall if it be taken with water of Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the which is made as hereafter followeth.

                     <p>VInegar is made of wine, and of water. Whereas there is wine, they make it of wine, but in thoſe Countries where there groweth no wine, they make it of beer and ale, in ſtead of wine, the which Vinegar is very ſtrong. Nevertheleſſe, it hath not the vertue and qualitie of that which is made of wine, becauſe his nature is to preſerve thoſe things which are put therein, as is ſaid before. If yee doe diſtill Vinegar in <hi>Balneo</hi> untill it remain drie, and then burn thoſe Feſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they come white, and then lay them in a moiſt place, it will turn into Oyle, the which is of ſuch vertue for mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that it is not to be credited, for if yee give thereof a ſmall quantitie to drink, it will diſſolve the Gravel, and Stone in the Bladder. And therefore this is a worthy ſecret to be known, the which was never revealed before to any man: As for his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues, they are known to all men. Diſtilled Vinegar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixed with a little oyle of Tartar and <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> preſerveth the face, and maketh it fair, but if it were not a ſin to offend God, I could ſay ſuch great and ſtrange things of diſtilled

                     <p>Take the Feſſes of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> made with Roch Allom, <hi>Sal Niter,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> two pound, <hi>Allum du Feſſe</hi> two pound, mix them well together, and put them into a Furnace to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, untill it become to a hard ſtone: and when it is calcined, make it preſently into powder, and ſet it four or five nights in the ayre, and it will turn moiſt, then take ſix pound of pure <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> without flegm, and put therein the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo let it remain eight daies, every day ſtirring it once, then pour of that part which is clear, and keep it as a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jewell, then take the Feſſes and calcine them again, as yee did at the firſt, and make them in powder again: And this powder mundifieth all filthie and ſtinking ſores, and with this water thou mayeſt help them, if that the workman can apply it with reaſon. Alſo with this water may be done great cures in Phyſick, if it be given as it ought to be. Alſo of the ſaid powder there may be made Pills and Potions, that worketh miracles in the world, as I have ſeen divers times.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45531:100"/>
and it is of great vertue, and appropriate for many things. But when it ſhall be diſtilled with Hony, and <hi>Allum du Feſſe</hi> in a Limbeck of glaſſe, it will be a miraculous remedie for Impoſthumes that are very hot. It maketh women fair and ſhining, if they waſh them therewith. But if this be mixed with oyle of Talk, it will reſtore the ſight unto thoſe that are almoſt blind. Alſo two drachms of diſtilled Verjuyce, with two drachms of the juyce of Betonie, and four ounces of Milk being uſed, will make a man very luxurious, and help a weak back.

Alſo this ſtone being in fine powder, and made into a Lineament with Vineger, Oil of Roſes, and a little Litarge, helpeth Scabs, and quencheth their heat, and cooleth the blood. Alſo two drachms of this powder being eaten with Sugar roſate, helpeth thoſe which have inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Take that maſſe of matter and ſtamp it, and ſearce it very fine, and then put it into a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that is apt to reſiſt the fire, and ſet it in a glaſſe Furnace for twenty or thirty dayes, and then it will be a red maſſe, the which yee ſhall beat into an impalpable powder, the which if thou wilt uſe in Phyſick thou maiſt diſſolve in Vinegar, and when it is diſſolved keep it for inflammations of the Liver and Stomack, the which thou mayeſt give with any kind of Sirrup appropriate, for this is a miraculous Medicine againſt the flux of the body.

                     <p>REd Corall is a ſtone, the which moſt commonly doth grow upon baked ſtones or bricks, and to approve it to be ſo, there is a certain Iſland of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> the which is called Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, the which was ſometimes inhabited, but ſithence the Sea hath over-run a great part thereof, and ſo the ſtones of the houſes, and the Bricks were ſcattered in the bottome of that Sea, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:45531:105"/>
at this time the <hi>Genoes</hi> gathered a great quantitie of Red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the faireſt in all the world. I call to remembrance that in the yeer 1549. I being in <hi>Meſſina,</hi> a famous Citie in the Realm of <hi>Cicilia,</hi> I ſaw a Fiſherman caſt his Net in the gate hard by the tower called <hi>Salvatore;</hi> and he took up a branch of red Corall that was grown upon a Brick, and was of ſuch greatneſſe and beautie, as had not been ſeen in two hundred yeers before. So that by this I have proved, that the Corall doth grow upon Bricks, or baked ſtones, and theſe have great vertue in Phyſick and Chirurgerie, when they be diſſolved in the juyce of Limons, or diſtilled Vinegar. For howſoever it be taken inwardly, it comforteth the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and maketh the heart merrie, diſſolveth the Fever, and not without great cauſe. For it is ſo good of nature, that our nature doth deſire it. Corall being calcined and diſſolved with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or with our Quinteſſence of Wine, helpeth very much againſt Ulcers, becauſe it taketh away the pain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and mundifieth, and incarnateth, and cicatrizeth.

And to prove that which I have ſaid, yee may ſee that the world cannot live without it. Moreover this Salt ſerveth much in Phyſick and Chirurgery, for they put it into Cliſters, and lay it alſo upon wounds. But I have found a way to prepare this Salt ſweet like Sugar, but yet Salt, and is of ſuch a pleaſant taſt, that it comforteth them that uſe it, and this is called <hi>Sal conditum Leonardo,</hi> the which Salt is good againſt Worms, and comforteth the ſtomack, cauſeth an appetite, purgeth the Urine, with a number of

Alſo if thoſe that have the <hi>Etica</hi> or Tiſſick doe drinke it with <hi>Mel Roſarum,</hi> it will doe them great pleaſure, it ſerveth alſo to make the hair of the head or beard black.

For if ye put it into Gangrena, or other putrified Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, it doth mundifie it with great ſpeed: It mortifieth Warts Chaps, Fiſtulaes, and any kind of thoſe humours. If it be drunken with Wine or other liquor, it is good againſt Fevers of any qualitie. Then his Feces being reduced into water with Vinegar, and his Salt being taken out, it is of ſuch vertue, that in a manner it will make men immortall.

                     <p>THere are three ſorts, or kinds, found of common Salt, the one is natural, the which is found in Mountaines, as in <hi>Naples</hi> in the Province of <hi>Calabria,</hi> where are great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of it, and alſo in <hi>Spain</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Anviſa,</hi> and this is the Mineral Salt. The ſecond kind is Artificial, as is made in <hi>Germany</hi> in their Cauldrons. The third kind is alſo natural of the Sea, which is made upon dry ſands in pits, by force of the Sun; but the moſt ſweet and ſavoureſt is that which is made with fire, becauſe it is purified and clean: The Salt of the Mountain is of more vertue then all the reſt in Phyſick; for when it ſhall be calcined forty dayes together in a Furnace, and then diſſolved with our Quinteſſence of Honey, ſo that there remain no Feces, it will be of ſuch vertue, that in manner it will revive the dead, if you give them thereof a ſpoonful. With this the antienteſt Doctors did marvellous things, and they called it the Salt of Wiſdome, for he that knew well his vertues would marvel thereat. This Salt ſerveth alſo againſt the infirmities of Oxen.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hirurgery is both Science and practiſe, and to ſay the truth, he that will know the compoſition of mans body, muſt of neceſſity have ſome Science, and be Anatomiſt, although the ſame Science be a thing to be learned by practiſe, for I have ſeen many times, thoſe which were unlearned, to be expert in the Anatomy of mans body, and thoſe were Painters and Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the which was neceſſary for them to know to frame their figures accordingly: and therefore I take not that for Science, but practiſe: For Science is onely that wherewith the cauſes of every infirmity is found out, and is of ſmall effect to our purpoſe, becauſe Chirurgery helpeth not onely the cauſe, but alſo the effect after it is known, and therefore I may ſay, that Chirurgery is no other then a pure and meer practiſe, and that it is onely neceſſary for the Chirurgian to know how to ſtitch a Wound well, to mundifie an Ulcer, and to keep it from putrifaction, and keep it from alteration, ſo that there run no evill humours unto the place offended, and to know all kind of Unguents that are apt to heal all kind of Wounds and Ulcers, which thing muſt be known by practiſe, And likewiſe to make all manner of Unguents neceſſary for Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, and for that cauſe I conclude moſt truly, that our Chirurgery is onely practiſe or experience. And that which cauſeth me to beleeve it is, that I have alwayes ſeen the moſt part of Chirurgians, when they ſhould have any caſe in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, they knew not what Unguent would help the ſore, but many times they prove this, and that, and ſo continue untill they have found one that is convenient for the ſore, whereunto it is applyed, and therefore this is a certain ſigne, that they know not by Science their Medicine to help the ſore, but with experience they ſearch it. Therefore if it be ſo,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45531:115"/>
it is a ſign that I have ſaid the truth, and ſo conclude, that Chirurgery is a practiſe to help ſores on mens bodies, and alſo on beaſts, when occaſion ſhall ſerve.</p>

                     <head>What Wounds are.</head>
                     <p>VVOunds are thoſe which in Latine are called <hi>Vulnus,</hi> and of the vulgar <hi>Vulnera,</hi> and they are of two kinds, that is, ſimple, and compound. The ſimple are thoſe that are onely in the fleſh, the compound are thoſe where are cut Sinewes, Veins, Muſckles, and Bones, and theſe are of divers and ſundry kinds, And the difference that is among them is, by the variety of the place where they are wounded, and by the difference of the weapon wherewith they were hurt, for ſome goe right, ſome overthwart, ſome long, ſome broad, ſome are thruſts or ſtocate, that offend divers parts of the body. The ſimple are of ſmall importance, becauſe if yee keep them clean and cloſe ſhut, nature will heal them without any kind of Medicine. But thoſe, where Veins are cut, have need of ſome art or practiſe, with the which they may ſtop the bloud, and in any wiſe not to ſuffer the wound to remain open, but to ſow it up very cloſe, ſo that the Vein may heal. Alſo thoſe where Sinews are hurt are of great importance, and would be healed with great ſpeed, ſo that the Sinews may joyn with more eaſe. But thoſe where Bones are hurt, are of greater importance, for if the Bone be ſeparated from the other, of neceſſity it muſt be taken forth before the Wound be healed. So that by this means every one may know what Wounds are, and their kinds.</p>

                     <p>ULcers are of divers and ſundry kinds, and are ingendered of many cauſes, as hereafter I will ſhew. But firſt I will write of thoſe kind of Ulcers that are cauſed of Wounds. You ſhall underſtand, that Wounds, in what part of the body ſoever they be, being impoſthumated, or cancrenated, they change their names, and are no more called Wounds, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45531:116"/>
the originall was a wound. For when it is cancrena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera corroſiva,</hi> becauſe it goeth eating and creeping on the fleſh. But when the wound is impoſthuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and full of matter, it is called, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera putrida,</hi> that is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, and it is becauſe it is filthy and ſtinketh. But when it is neither cancrenated, nor yet apoſthumated, but that through ſome evill diſpoſition the wound is cloſed, and that there cometh in it evill qualities without alteration, then it is called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera ſordida,</hi> becauſe therein is evill qualitie, and it appeareth but a little, but it is evill to heal. There be other ſorts of Ulcers alſo, the which are cauſed of divers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry kinds of tumours, and the moſt evill and miſchievous are thoſe that are of tumours cauſed of the Pox, for unto thoſe there runneth abundance of evill humours that augment the Ulcer, and they be the worſt ſort, for they cannot be healed by themſelves, except the body be well purged and evacuated of all the humours that are offenſive. There is another kind of Ulcer the which cometh of an Impoſthume, as well hot as cold, and thoſe are more gentle and eaſie to be helpt, if yee know the Medicines that are apt to help and diſſolve thoſe kind of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the three kind of Ulcers that commonly happen unto men and women through divers cauſes, as it is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo that theſe are the principall cauſes of thoſe malign Ulcers.</p>

                     <p>ALl manner of Sores that doe not ſiccatrize perfectly, and have communication with the inward parts, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fiſtulaes, and we term them in Italian <hi>Sofio,</hi> or <hi>Spiraculo,</hi> as yee may ſee by experience, and this is perillous, when a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula cloſeth, being in the body, and ſpecially thoſe Fiſtulaes that are in the Fundament, for Nature her ſelf doth ingender it for eaſe. But theſe Fiſtulaes that come in divers parts of the body are troubleſome, but not perillous: Alſo all ſuch ſores as tarry long before they be incarnated come to Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes, and many times it cometh through their being long curing, by tenting with their tents, which are the cauſes that Nature maketh a <hi>Callow,</hi> and leaveth the ſore ſo hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it will never be filled with fleſh, but ſo remain hollow, as it is ſeen eaſily by experience. There be other ſorts of Fiſtulaes in form of a ſore, and they be thoſe ſores that moſt commonly come on the leggs, the which doe purge a long time, and are alſo very hard to heal, becauſe if yee heal one of them preſently, there will riſe another hard by it, and that is a kind of Fiſtula<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is another kind of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula that is cauſed of thoſe ſores that are upon the bone, the which by his continuance doe break and conſume the skin and the bone, and theſe many times remain Fiſtulated, but who ſo taketh away the cauſe of the ſore, nature it ſelf will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail mightily, and will heal it, as may be ſeen daily by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, in thoſe that be ſo troubled. The Fiſtulaes that come in the eyes, are called <hi>Fiſtula Lachrymoſa,</hi> and they have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45531:117"/>
ſome communication with the inward parts, and are evill to be healed. Becauſe firſt the cauſe muſt be taken away inwardly, and then nature will heal it by it ſelf, as I have ſeen by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, ſo that theſe are the kinds of Fiſtulaes moſt known unto all men, and the cauſes of theſe Fiſtulaes are two, and for my part I am fully perſwaded it is ſo. The Firſt is of wounds evill healed, that remain Fiſtulated. The Second cauſe, I find to be of ſores cauſed of the Pox, and to ſhew a truth, yee ſhall cure them of the Pox, and their Fiſtulaes will heal of themſelves without any other help, as it is daily to be ſeen. There may be many other cauſes the which as yet I know not, but theſe two are a ſufficient reaſon, and to be conſidered of the Profeſſors of this Art, if they deſire to come to any excellency; and therefore I will reaſon no more of the matter, becauſe the Science, and my experience will reach no further.</p>

The firſt kind of Scab is that which is cauſed of <hi>Ripletion</hi> of the body, by eating much meat of great nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then not to digeſt it, ſo in that cauſe nature, to eaſe it ſelf, ſendeth forth that humiditie, and when it joyneth to the skin, it ingroſſeth and cauſeth an Impoſthume, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the outward parts, it is alreadie corrupted, and ſo cauſeth the Puſtulaes, as by experience may be ſeen, and this kinde is a viſcous and fat humour with great humidity. There is another kind of Scab that is alwaies dry with redneſſe, and is ſmall, with great heat and Itching, and the ſame in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is cauſed by much heat of the Liver; and aduſtion of blood, and may be healed eaſily. There is another kind of great ſcab that hath a great dry cruſt on them, and they grow big, and the ſame is of the French Pox being new taken. There is another kind like <hi>Serpigo,</hi> that goeth creeping, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45531:117"/>

I will ſhew you the reaſon: You ſhall underſtand, that when a wound doth offend the Interior parts, the Phyſitian or Chrurgian, or great <hi>Anatomiſt</hi> whatſoever he be, cannot know all thoſe parts offended in the body, for after the weapon is within the bodie, it may turn, and with the point hurt other parts afar off the wound, and offend divers particular parts one different from the other, and therefore I beſeech you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Chirurgians, when ſuch a caſe cometh, how doe you know or diſcern which parts are hurt? but to ſay the truth, I beleeve in that caſe they know all alike, but what ſhould I ſay of the cure of ſuch a wound, if the Chirurgian know not where it is, nor of what importance, but worketh by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and if that Nature doth prevail, and that the wound doth heal, it is by the good fortune of the Phyſitian, ſo that for wounds inwardly I, conclude no other at this time, but will leave it to thoſe that know more then I, and hereafter I will diſcourſe of Ulcers and Impoſthumes inwardly, what they are, and how to cure them with our order: yee ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that there are a number of kinds of Ulcers and Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes that may ingender inwardly, but it ſeemeth to me ſo hard to underſtand, that I can determine nothing that were true, and the cauſe is this, that we have ſeen an infinite of Phyſitians and Chirurgians that have viſited one Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humated, or Ulcerated, and the Phyſitian could not know the place, and particular of that Impoſthume or Ulcer, if that the Patient do not tell him and ſhew him, and cauſe him to feel with his hand, and this is moſt true, and therefore if one cannot reſolve him of outward things, that he may ſee and feel with his hand, how can he reſolve him when one of thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents is within the bodie, where the Patient knows not himſelf, which is grieved?

The three operations that the Maſter hath to doe are theſe: To defend the Wound ſo that there runneth no humours to it, and that it putrfie not, and to keep it clean, and when the Miniſter hath done that, let Nature work that which ſhe will work well, and if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee if it will be ſo in effect, yee may ſee by a Dog, for if he hath a great wound upon his body, he healeth it without any Medicine, onely with diet, and keeping it clean with his tongue, and this is moſt true, that thoſe which doe help Wounds by inchantment, doe nothing but keep the Wound clean, and cauſe the Patient to keep a diet, and ſo nature work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as well on a Man as on a Dog, therefore let none marvell of this authority of a Dog, although I approve the like of a Chriſtian. But for ſo much as it would be good to help Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it might work with more ſpeedineſſe, as Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gardners doe, who becauſe they would have Nature to work the better, and quicker in their ground, doe caſt thereon divers ſorts of dungs, &amp;c. The which is done onely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45531:119"/>
to help Nature to work the quicker, and to conclude, I ſay, that the Chirurgian ſhould doe the ſame in helping of Wounds. But as for Ulcers of divers ſorts, it were neceſſary to find out the cauſe, becauſe they come of divers cauſes, for when the cauſe is found, it will be more eaſie to be helped, becauſe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers cannot come but by great diſtemperance of Nature in our bodies, as by great heat or cold, or by repletions of the body. Therefore in this caſe it is neceſſary to purge the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Firſt, to eaſe Nature which is offended, and to extinguiſh the ſuperfluous heat or cold that is in the bodie: That being done, the miniſter or helper of Nature hath three things to doe. The firſt is to mortifie or kill the ſore, the ſecond to mundifie, and the third to incarnate, and then Nature will cicatrize it, and theſe three operations are to be uſed in Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Alſo Impoſthumes are cauſed of divers accidents, in the which it is alſo neceſſary to ſeek out the cauſe, whereby to know what purgations are fit to purge the body of the ſuperfluous humours, and then the Miniſter hath three things to doe in that caſe. Firſt to bring it to maturation quickly, then when it is ripe and broke, to mundifie it well, and thirdly to incarnate it, and theſe are the three operations that are to be done in an Impoſthume to help Nature to work well, and ſo following this order thy work ſhall prove well, and goe the right way, as hereafter I will ſhew in his place, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to uſe in the effect, with the order to help them, and alſo to make thy Unguents, ſhewing their quality and vertue, and will prove by reaſon thoſe things that are doubtfull, ſo that every one ſhall be ſatisfied in that matter.</p>

need be, to ſtitch them cloſe, and then let Nature work, the which in ſhort time will heal them, but if thou by Art wilt help nature, thou ſhalt annoint them with oyle of frankincenſe once a day. But Wounds, where Veines are cut, have need of preſent help, and artificiall meanes, and ſufficient remedies to help it, with as much ſpeed as may be, ſo that the Veins cut may joyn again together, without any great offence of the Wound, and that is done in this order.

                     <p>Give them our <hi>Pillole Aquilone</hi> three times, the quantitie is from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. i. to one and a half; that being done, yee ſhall make them a decoction of Hyſope of the mountain, and put therein Sugar, and this they ſhall uſe ten or twelve daies at the leaſt, for this mundifieth the place offended, and diſpoſeth it to ſolution. Then after this is done, yee ſhall give him for ten daies together half a drachm of Maſtick, with a little Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain water, for this is hot and reſtringeth the pores, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſeth the Urine, and ſo the Patient ſhall remain whole of that infirmitie, by the vertue of the aforeſaid three Medicines, and it is a very eaſie cure, and ſoveraign for that purpoſe. But ſometime there happeneth a Flux of Urine ſomewhat like this, and it is not of the aforeſaid cauſes, but of cauſes much different from them,, for this is in men and women of age, and thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe Urine is ſtaid through divers and ſundry cauſes, and the principall are three, of the which one is the Stone that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendereth in the Bladder, for alwaies it hangeth down in the neck of the Bladder, and ſtoppeth the <hi>Meatus,</hi> or pores that the Urine cannot paſſe, the which grieveth the Patient mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly. The other is cauſed of gravell, or groſſe and viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous humours that cannot paſſe the pores, and ſo cauſe that retention of Urine with great pain. The third is cauſed of an obſtruction or reſtriction of the pores or conduits, where the Urine doth paſſe, and ſo keepeth the Urine within with great pain, ſo that theſe bee the three chiefeſt cauſes of the retenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Urine</p>
                     <p>The cure of the firſt cauſe which is the Stone, is to purge them well, and then to uſe our moſt ſoveraign Remedie that is written in this Book following, the which is of great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to break the Stone, as I have proved many times, but when this Medicine is not able to break it, then it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to cut it forth, and this is all concerning the firſt cauſe.</p>
                     <p>To help the ſecond cauſe, it were neceſſary to uſe Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that purge the Reins well, and then to give them our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> and then to annoint the Reins ſix dayes every day once with <hi>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45531:130"/>
is a certain heat, the which corrupteth the place where it paſſeth and carrieth forth, as it were, certain long threds, the which cauſeth that burning.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45531:139"/>
when we were in the midſt of the gulf between <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Palermo,</hi> there happened a great miſ-fortune, the which was thus.</p>
                     <p>In the Gallie of <hi>Si. Giordano</hi> Captain General of the Gallies Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> it happened that he being at the table with divers Captains and Gentlemen, and as they were, at dinner, a certain Captain being grieved with another, multiplyed words, and took a loaf of bread, and threw it at his face, without any reverence or reſpect of the ſaid Generall <hi>Sig. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordano.</hi> That being done, the ſaid Generall roſe from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and took him by the boſome, and gave him five ſtocadoes in the breaſt, the which pierced within the bodie, and there he fell for dead: that being done, the ſaid Generall repented himſelf of his raſhneſſe, and preſently ſent for me being in the Gallie of <hi>Don Gracia</hi> to come and dreſſe him, and ſo my Generall cauſed me to doe with all diligence, and when I came, this poor Captain lay as though he had been dying, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe I dreſſed him with great diligence, and that Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which I uſed were theſe: Firſt, I put into the wounds, of our <hi>Qiunteſſence,</hi> and upon the wound I dreſſed it with our Balm artificiall, and gave him a vomit, the which cauſed him to caſt great quantitie of bloud, and then every morning I gave him half an ounce of our <hi>Aqua Balſami,</hi> and thus within two days after we arrived at <hi>Palermo,</hi> the Captain was perfectly whole, to the great marvell of a number. After that we depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Palermo,</hi> and went to the Citie of <hi>Trapano,</hi> where the reſt of the gallies were, and there continued four dayes, and then on Saint <hi>Johns</hi> even, we went to an Iſland called <hi>Fanig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nana,</hi> and there kept the feaſt of Saint <hi>John,</hi> and then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with all the army, and went on the ſide of <hi>Africa,</hi> and on Saint <hi>Peters</hi> day we landed in the Gardens of that Citie, and there began to offer battell, and there remaining about 24. or 25. dayes, the army began to be infected with a certain kind of flux, whereof a great number dyed every day. My Generall ſeeing that called me, and asked if it were poſſible to find ſome remedie for that flux, unto the which I anſwered willingly, and ſaid, I would deviſe by the help of God ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, becauſe it was my dutie, to labour for the health of

                     <p>VVOunds in the head were very perillous in that place, ſo that if a hundered were hurt in the head, it was not poſſible to recover ten, and that came through two things, the which were much contrary in that Region, for the day was ſo hot that it burned all things, and the night to the contrary ſo extream cold, that it was intolerable, and not to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo by this diſtemperance, when the <hi>Craneum</hi> was unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that the aire might touch it, preſently they died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any help, then I ſeeing that, began to conſider of the

Then preſently I commanded all thoſe Chirurgians that were under my jurisdiction that they ſhould not meddle with any wound in the head without my preſence, the which thing was done, and as many as were wounded, the firſt thing that I did, in ſtead of cutting or launcing or diſcovering, according to the common order, I joyned the parts, and ſowed them cloſe, and dreſſed them upon the wound with our <hi>Quinteſſence,</hi> and with <hi>Balſamo,</hi> and <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and ſo in ſhort time the moſt part were hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and there died none ſo deſperate as they did before, and therefore to my judgement, this was a good invention, and never uſed of any before, and this order of curing is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naturall, for Nature doth ſhew it in hearbs, plants and ſtones, how that they cannot ſtand diſ-united, then much more our fleſh cannot ſtand diſ-united, without great torment of the Patient, for untill it be joyned together again, it is unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be helped, then ſeeing that is true, it is moſt naturall for the wound to be joyned together, and to uſe thoſe Medicines, that where they be applyed, will not ſuffer the humour to come thereunto, nor putrifie the place that is hurt, and ſeeing it is ſo, as by experience is ſeen, we muſt beleeve this to be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and moſt wholſome remedie, ſo that I affirm that the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the parts of the wound in the head, and other parts of the body is moſt ſoveraign, and of great ſatisfaction to the ſick, for they never felt pain, nor have no Fever, nor other ſort of accident, for of thoſe I have cured a great number with good ſucceſſe.</p>

                     <p>IN the year aforeſaid, and in the moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> there came to my hand a certain Gentleman of the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Portingall, that was called <hi>Il ſignior Jari,</hi> a man of the age of two and thirtie yeares, of complexion me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, the which had a putrified Ulcer about the left ſhoulder, that he had carried above three yeares, and was as big as a hand, and very deep, which could not be healed of the common Chirurgians, nor yet be eaſed of his pain, then I reaſoning with this Gentleman, told him that the cauſe of that ſore, was corrupt and putrified bloud, and by that meanes the Liver received evill qualities, and that if he would be helped, the cauſe muſt be removed, the which was hard to be done, becauſe the bloud muſt be evacuated a little, and then the ſtomack muſt be evacuated of moiſt matter that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth it, and hindereth digeſtion of the meat, and will not ſuffer good bloud to ingender; then will it alſo be neceſſary to evacuate the body downwards, that the corruption ſend not up his vapours unto the upper parts of the body, and hinder the cure of the Ulcer, all this being done, it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to evacuate the humour between the skin and the fleſh by ſweat, ſo that all the parts of the body may remain purified, and ſo by theſe meanes the Ulcer may eaſily mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, incarnate, and ſiccatrize, and ſhall be a perfect cure: to the which thing the Gentleman was willing, for he had as willingly dyed as lived, and ſo in the name of God I took him in hand, and the firſt thing that I gave him was a vomit that purged the ſtomack, and took away great part of his pain: then I purged him with our <hi>Quinta eſſentia ſolutivo</hi> eight daies together, that being done, I made him a Fomentation that cauſed him to ſweat well, and to ſpit abundance, then I cauſed him to be let bloud under the tongue, and then I annointed all the Ulcer with our <hi>Cauſtick,</hi> the which mortified all the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therein, and then I dreſſed it with <hi>Magno liquore,</hi> and our Cerot <hi>Magiſtrale,</hi> and ſo with theſe Remedies in ſhort ſpace the ſaid Gentleman was cured, to the great marvell of

                     <head>Here beginneth the order to make divers and ſundry Medicines of our invention never found out before by any man. And firſt to make our <hi>Petra Philoſophale,</hi> that helpeth againſt all manner of diſeaſes that happeneth unto man, or woman, or any other Animall terreſtriall.</head>
                     <p>THere hath alwayes been a great queſtioning among the Philoſophers, whether that one Medicine might help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all diſeaſes or no. The which I affirm, and will approve with ſufficient reaſon, that the <hi>Petra Philoſophale</hi> made of our invention may help againſt all the infirmities that cometh unto mans body, and two onely reaſons I will ſhew thee with brevity, the firſt of them is this, that all ſorts of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities have their Originall and beginning of the ſtomack, and to know the truth, yee may ſee manifeſtly, that if the body be never ſo little infirmed, the ſtomack is alſo greived: For yee may ſee how the Animals terreſtriall never help themſelves of other infirmity then of the ſtomack, and when they will help themſelves, they eat hearbs, the which cauſeth them to vomit, and this doth ſignifie, that they have no other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity then the aforeſaid, ſo by the experience of the Animals I approve that the infirmity is cauſed of the ſtomack, and this is the firſt reaſon. The ſecond is, that all the Medicines, wherein our <hi>Petra Philoſophale</hi> is put, as ſoon as they are come into the ſtomack, it draweth unto it all the evill humours of the ſtomack, and alſo of the whole body, and mixeth with them, and ſo natrue ſendeth them forth by vomit, or by ſeege, or both, and ſo the ſtomack ſhall be evacuated of that matter, and the body remain free from all impediments of infirmities, ſo that by this reaſon I affirm, that our <hi>Petra Philoſophale</hi> may help againſt all ſorts of infirmities, and to know the truth, I have proved it by experience in all manner of infirmities, and alwayes have found it to doe much good unto all men, and hurt none unto my knowledge, and the order to make this <hi>Petra Philoſophale</hi> is thus.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45531:160"/>
in which there entereth part of poyſon, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb ſaith, that one poyſon killeth another, and that I will approve in this Chapter, and the order to make this Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is thus.</p>

                     <p>THe Turpentine of <hi>Ciprus</hi> is a kinde more finer then our Turpentine, and without compariſon, and of more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue then ours is, and this the Doctors ſay, doth diſſolve pains and preſerveth the body, if it bee taken inwardly, becauſe they ſay, That Turpentine is an uncorruptible Gum, the which is moſt true. But in that Gum there is one part thick and groſſe that hindereth his operation, and he that can ſeparate this groſſe part from the noble parts, ſhall doe great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders therewith: It is needfull then with the fire, and the means of our Quinteſſence, to make the ſeparation of the Elements, the which are four, Water, Oyle, Liquor and Earth. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is profitable, the Oyle is perfect, the Liquor is noble,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45531:166"/>
and the Earth that remaineth, is ſpoiled, and of no ſubſtance, and with thoſe things thou mayeſt doe high and great cures, when they are applyed according as they ought to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many good and profitable things, through the want of perfect application in time and place, many times doe hurt, and to ſhew the truth, I will ſhew thee an example of wine, the which is a precious liquor, the which being drunk in the morning is hurtfull to many, to eat meat betwixt meals is not good, and many ſuch like things, that when they be not done with order doe hurt, and therefore it is neceſſary for thoſe that will underſtand, that matter to be of a good intelligence, as well in making it, as in uſing or applying it to the ſick.</p>

                  <head>To the Freindly Reader, as much health as he wiſheth of Soul and Body.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>EN many times meddle in ſome matters, wherein they take more toile then thank for their labours; and he, which thinks in the night that he hath pleaſed all, ſhall find in the morning that he hath angered ſome. So many as know me wel, and whereto I was cheifly adicted within theſe eight or nine yeares, that is, unto the ſtudy and practiſe of the ſoul Phyſick, may now make a queſtion of my medling ſo long with bodily Phyſick. But my twofold anſwer they may take with them for their ſatisfaction: Firſt, that I keep ſtill <hi>Depoſitum illud,</hi> which God hath committed unto me (and ſealed the ſame by mine own ſpirituall birth, and other mens ſanctification) till he that hath ſaid, Goe, points the time, and gives the occaſion of my further ſervice in that weighty Function. Secondly, as when I converſed in that calling I was chargeable to none, ſo (not ſurceaſing the ſame of mine own accord) I have ſince, by God his bleſſing of my labours here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as not greatly inriched my ſelf, ſo not impoveriſhed any: That wherein I have thus continued, ſeeing it concerneth learning, and an honeſt mans maintenance, cannot, or ought not to offend any that are well in their wits. Theſe few ſecrets contained in this Collection, and Appendix thereto adjoyning (which I have reduced into method for his ſake that gathered them here and there) cannot, or ought not to ſcandalize any, that have a ſanctified cunning in Phyſick or Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. I muſt needs tell thee, that I lean more to that ſafe, ſpeedy, and pleaſant kind of curation, with Medicines rightly prepared, then to the careleſſe Compoſition, made by addition of other ſimples, clogged with more impurities then are in that ſimple which they labour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. I dare alſo avouch, that any poor body may better commit his craſie body, to be healed or helped of any outward or inward malady, by the right prepared Medicines, for the value often Shillings (which he can hardly ſpare) then a wealthy man to their deceits (I would ſay receits) for ten Crownes, which he may well enough forbear: Many of the ignorant ſort have counted the Chymicall or <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi> Phyſick dangerous, and not without cauſe, for wofull experience
<pb facs="tcp:45531:168"/>
hath brought it into that ſuſpition. But (good Reader) hear me in that which Ile tell thee, and ſo take thine anſwer for this time: Some of the learned, and moſt of the ignorant, have in generall deſpiſed them, but by your leave, after they have heard a particular of the excellent ſucceſſe attained by many of them; they have adventured upon thoſe, without knowledge, experience, direction, and ſo have made many Patients to ſmart for it: Therefore I would not, that the fine fingered Phiſitian ſhould ſcorn to wear this Pearl, which is as fit for Sir <hi>John</hi> lack-Latine, for the Land-leaper, or cogging Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalver, as a Pipe for an Aſſe, or a Cage for a Cow. The Salts, Oyles, Waters, Extracts, Tinctures, Simples prepared, and Compoſitions of Simples conjoyned, mentioned in this book or not mentioned, I mean not to make ſale of (as the Grocer or the Apothecary doth,) but I keep them in ſtore, and mean to increaſe them for mine own uſe and my freinds, and for ſuch as ſhall need them, as the learned counſell of Phyſick rules ſhall give occaſion.</p>

that nature cannot prevail to conglutinate or ſoder the fleſh together; and thus, through want of natural heat, the wound falleth to Impoſthumation, <hi>Gangrena,</hi> Fiſtulaes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and can hardly be cured. The ſecond cauſe is, the keeping of them too much open, by reaſon of their tents or pledgets, ſo that they cannot joyn together again, but grow to Cancers and Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes, whereupon many times the Patient remaineth lame ever after, or elſe ſpeedy death is the end thereof.</p>

                     <p>THe pain in the head is an infirmity, whoſe cauſe untill this time hath not been ſufficiently known, as by mine own experience ſhall prove unto you.</p>
                     <p>All, or the moſt part of Phyſitians in the world doe hold this poſition, that pain in the head is no other thing, then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſing from the ſtomack, and aſcending unto the head, which doe offend <hi>membrana,</hi> whereupon enſueth pain. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſpeak ſome part of the truth; but (in my judgement)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45531:194"/>
they are not yet come perfectly to know all the cauſe of this infirmity: for I ſee, that in the cures, which theſe Theoricks would perform, it falleth not out according to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſire, for that they know not the whole, or the principall cauſe of the malady, therefore what certain Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine can they find out to cure the infirmity? They may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance (as the blind man hits the Crow) help they know not what; which thing I ſpeak not to back-bite or injury any of them, but to tell them, out of love that I bear to them and others, the whole and true cauſe of that, whereof heretofore they have been ignorant. The firſt cauſe is putrified bloud in <hi>Leonichi:</hi> The ſecond is the vapours that aſcend from the ſtomack and offend the head: The third is the humidity or moiſture between the skin and the fleſh: So that the cauſes are three, and the remedies as many to diſſolve the <hi>Antecedent</hi> cauſes. I have now ſhewed thee the originall and root of the pain in the head, about which thou ſhalt never more need to beat thy head, or break thy brains, either in ſeeking the <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> the <hi>Commentary</hi> of <hi>Galen,</hi> or the Authority of <hi>Avicen,</hi> for in theſe four or few words I have ſaid all. Now of the cure of this diſeaſe, as I have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the ſame an infinite ſort of times in my life, which way ſoever the cauſe cometh, work thou after this manner, and thou ſhalt never ſuſtain blame or diſcredit.</p>
                     <p>When the pain in the head is confirmed, and that thou canſt find no help by common <hi>Theorick</hi> or <hi>Practick</hi> doe theſe things following. Firſt let them bloud on <hi>Leonichie,</hi> cutting it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, and let the Patient ſpit as much as he can; then the next morning let them take our <hi>Aromatico</hi> faſting; the next day let the head be ſhaven, and lay thereon an attractive plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, drawing out the humidity, whereof I have made mention in my <hi>Caprici medicinale;</hi> in the end, cauſe them to ſneeze, and hereby all the pain in the head will ceaſe.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Catarre, and rhume in the head.</head>
                     <p>THe Catarre is a moiſt vapour which aſſaulteth the head, and afterwards falleth down again into the ſtomack, where
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45531:194"/>
it ingroſſeth and corrupteth. This moiſture hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the moiſture of the Lungs, and untill ſuch time as the Lungs be diſcharged thereof, the Catarre will continue in his force. This infirmity reigneth more in flegmatick and melancholy bodies, then in any of other conſtitutions: Such as are troubled with it are not long lived, becauſe their Lungs conſume by little and little, and thereupon they are troubled with the <hi>Ptiſick,</hi> and conſequently they periſh if they be not quickly releived. I will now ſhew thee a rare ſecret to cure the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pulmonaria,</hi> and <hi>Sena,</hi> that is freſh and new, infuſe them in wine and water over a ſmall or gentle fire, till the wine have drawn out the vertue; then ſtrain it, and put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our <hi>Quinteſſence,</hi> and keep it cloſe in a glaſſe, let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient drink thereof every morning ℥. iii. luke warm for twenty dayes together; let him eat good nouriſhing meats, for they agree well with this diſeaſe: If the Patient be not too farre ſpent, you ſhall ſee your cure performed in ſhort time: In the mean while, if the Patient be weak, you ſhall give him new laid Eggs, and good white Wine: If the humidity be perceived not to be quite expelled and evacuated, then give him our <hi>Aromatico,</hi> afterward comfort him again with Reſtoratives and Cordials to make him ſtrong, and no doubt, by the help of God he ſhall be cured. This method of curing this infirmity, differeth from the common courſe that Phyſitians take, which would cure it with diet, bleeding, and mollifying liniments, and cauſing them to ſpit, and ſuch like, which are meanes rather to augment the Catarre, then to diminiſh the ſame.</p>

dry; and the vegetable <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> preſerveth the body from all ill and noyſome infirmities. The Electuary muſt be taken firſt in the morning; of the <hi>Quinteſſence ſolutive</hi> you muſt take a ſpoonfull in the morning in a little broth and ſugar, keeping a reaſonable good diet, and doe this four or ſix dayes; then take the Pills in the evening, and in the mean time annoint the head and ſtomack with <hi>Oleum Cerae,</hi> and drink every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little of our <hi>Quinteſſence,</hi> which if you doe uſe continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (by the bleſſing of God upon it) there is no doubt, but the body ſhall be free from many troubleſome maladies.</p>

Theſe <hi>Scrophulae</hi> are a long time ere they will come to ſuppuration; and before they break, and when they are broken, they cauſe exceſſive pain, and are hard to be cured: For all infirmities that come of melancholy, are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to cure, or reſolve, as you may ſee in the Quartain, and ſuch like.

                     <p>THis grievous and intollerable maladie, (as thoſe know well that have felt them) cometh on the end of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and is an infirmitie bred in the liver, whereof nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to diſcharge her ſelf, ſendeth it to the extream parts of the fingers, and moſt commonly it cometh to the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger next the thumb, but ſeldome in the other. The reaſon or cauſe whereof is hidden, ſave that we may conjecture (as wee have ſaid before) an accident in the Liver, which nature ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth unto thoſe parts to eaſe her ſelfe. When it cometh to the end of the finger, that it can go no further, it cauſeth a ſharp and exceſſive pain; and the accident coming unto that place, not having paſſage, is ſo hot, that in ſhort time it putrifieth the ſinews, muſcles, and cartilages, and in the end rotteth both fleſh and bone. The ſecret of this grief is not commonly known of the moſt Chirurgians, who with all their learning cannot deviſe to cure it as it ought to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

This is the beginning of the French-Pox, a fit ſauce for that ſweet ſin of <hi>Letchery.</hi> It bringeth moſt commonly paine in the interior parts, or paine in the reines, arms, and legs: inſomuch that in fine it cometh to that fowle diſeaſe.

                     <p>Firſt you ſhall give them our <hi>Aromatico</hi> once in white Wine; Then morning and evening for ſeven or eight daies uſe this potion following: annointing alſo the reines and thoſe parts with our <hi>Aqua faetida</hi> being cold, and in ſhort time they ſhall be healed.</p>

Commonly the originall and beginning thereof is cauſed of the Pox, a thing that muſt be conſidered of in the cure. Now for the cure, it were neceſſary to help the Liver, to purifie the bloud, to alter
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45531:199"/>
the <hi>Emeroides,</hi> and to diſcharge nature of that impediment.

                        <p>BY reaſon of this diſeaſe that cometh alwaies at the end of <hi>Inteſtino,</hi> or <hi>Longanon,</hi> ſome have marvelous paine about the fundament, ſome burn wonderfully, and others do ſcald: which commeth becauſe of the good or bad qualities in ſome, more then in other ſome, as experience ſheweth. For (as I ſaid) ſome have ſuch a burning, that they can take no reſt, ſome have ſuch paine as they cannot ſit, ſome have it ſo ſcalding hot that it is intollerable. Though this infirmity is more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in one complexion then in another, and the cure hard, yet you ſhall cure them in this manner.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, give them <hi>Aromatico,</hi> then purge the body five or ſix times with our <hi>Sirrupo ſolutivo.</hi> Then give him our fume at the lower parts, three or four times, and then annoint the parts with our <hi>Balſamo Artiſiciato,</hi> for that will dry and take away the paine altogether, and the Patient ſhall be ſurely healed.</p>
                        <p>There are divers kinds of <hi>Emeroides,</hi> but two in principall. The one ſort is in the fundament, and cauſeth great paine when they go to the ſtoole. The other ſort commeth forth of the fundament and are not ſo painefull as the firſt. To cure thoſe within the fundament, you ſhall give the Patient eight or ten daies together our <hi>Sirrupo magiſtrale</hi> warm, then let them take our <hi>Aromatico</hi> once, and uſe Gliſters, wherein is put half an ounce of <hi>Aqua reale Phioravante</hi> at a time, and ſo thou ſhalt help them. The beſt way for thoſe that are come forth, is to make inciſion, or to make a little hole in them, that the bloud which is putrified may come forth, and ſo by evacuation thou ſhalt help them. Alſo you ſhall underſtand that vomiting is very neceſſary in the cure of both ſorts, becauſe it openeth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45531:199"/>
the veines. Alſo <hi>Oleum ovorum</hi> doth eaſe the paine of the <hi>Emeroides</hi> very greatly; ſo doth the oyle of Figs if you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint them therewith. The tooth of an horſe-fiſh being worn in a ring on the finger, after the body is purged, taketh them away by a ſecret and hidden quality, a thing proved more then an hundered times.</p>

That which moveth me to beleeve it, is the obſervation thereof divers and ſundry times, for I have cured many that were infected with the Pox, which were troubled, ſome with Carnoſity (before ſpoken of) ſome with gravell, ſome with debility of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue expulſive, ſome with <hi>Gonorrhaea:</hi> all which when I had cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Pox, the other diſtemperatures were therewith alſo cured. For that diſeaſe is the cauſe of twenty miſchiefs, and the reaſon why many Phyſitians make a long cure of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſtemperatures is, for that they know not the maine and

                     <p>THe Cornes that come on the feet, are a kind of hard Tumor, or thick excreſcence, cauſed of corrupt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified humours, whereof Nature being willing to diſcharge her ſelf, ſendeth them to the lower part of the feet, from whence, becauſe they cannot paſſe, there doe they make a reſidence: ingendering that kind of tough excreſcence, which is grievous and painfull.

For many great perſonages that live eaſily, and are tormented with the gout, have alſo this grief in thoſe parts, but the order to cure them is this. Firſt, you ſhall cut the naile on that part where it moſt grieveth them; then take it away, which you may doe eaſily without any great pain to the Patient: for the nail is already ſeparated from the grieved place.

                     <p>MAn is a rationall or reaſonable creature, whereof we have written at large in our book called <hi>Phiſica del Phiora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vante.</hi> But here we will onely write of certain Medicines, that may be made or derived from him, which are for the eaſe, help, and remedy of divers infirmities, which are in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: The reaſon whereof is very good, for every like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth with, and helpeth his like, and therefore man ſerveth for man. The fat of a man is (as every man knoweth) hot, and penetrative, and mollifying, if you annoint the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, where the ſinews be hard, and drawn together, or contracted, therefore it will quickly reſolve them. I have made the <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> of mans bloud, rectified and circulated, with the which I have done moſt wonderfull cures, for if you give thereof <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. i. it will reſtore thoſe that lie at the point of death.</p>
                     <p>It is moſt profitable againſt thoſe infirmities that are in the bloud, for it correcteth the malignity of the bloud, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth it, as well as the ſpirit of Wine. If you put a little of it into a hogſhead of Wine, it will purifie it, and preſerve it a long time, more then any other thing whatſoever: So that this <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> worketh more effects, for the cure of great and dangerous infirmities, then any other-</p>
                     <p>Alſo from the liver of a man will be drawn by diſtillation, a water and an oyle. If the water be drunk every morning together, by the ſpace of a moneth, the quantity of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. i. with ℥. ii. of Liverwort water, it will recover ſuch as are half rotten through diſeaſes of the liver, and hath divers other properties, whereof I will not ſpeak at this time.</p>
                     <p>From the fleſh of man diſtilled, there will come forth a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, and an oil, which is moſt excellent to annoint wounds withall when they are badly healed, and that there remain any hurt about thoſe parts, that they are not ſo ſenſible and pliant (as they were wont to be before) this reſolveth them: and it mollifieth and ſofteneth all hardneſſe of any tumour, of what origin all ſoever it ſhall come.</p>

For when as reports are ſpread of the ſtrange cures of ſundry greivous diſeaſes, which are wrought by the benefit of tinctures, and vegetall, and minerall ſpirits, by the cunning and labour of thoſe whom the common ſort at this day call Chymiſts, or Alchymiſts; by and by on the contrary part they cry out, that thoſe colliar Phiſitians can doe no good, but kill all men that put themſelves into their hands with their venomous Medicines, ſo that they ought to be driven out of the Common-wealth, and that they are deceivers, and that their extractions, and preparations, their ſubtill and thinne ſpirits will profit nothing, and that the ſpirit of <hi>Vitrioll</hi> is poyſon, the eſſence of <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> is nothing, the extraction of <hi>Sulphur</hi> is nothing worth, neither the liquor of Gold, and to be breif, that all things are contrary to the nature of man, and more to be avoided, then the eyes of a Baſilisk: and yet they, in the mean time, like cunning and crafty Theeve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not ſufficient for thee, by bringing thy reaſons, to prove, that metalline Medicines are not agreeing for mans nature, neither that metals may be ſo prepared that they may heal. Why? Thou denieſt that which indeed is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and openly ſeen with eyes. It is a foul thing to be ignorant in that that every man knoweth, for out of all doubt you have all heard, that moſt dangerous diſeaſes have been cured with metalline tinctures, yea, with ſuch as have not been rightly prepared by counterfet <hi>Paracelſians,</hi> as with <hi>Vitrum Antimonii,</hi> which doth pluck up ſuddenly at once by the roots the impurities of the Fever, although not without great weakening of the powers, yet it healeth; and yet we allow not of ſuch perillous cures: and ſo likewiſe of others.

I ſay, every <hi>Paracelſian,</hi> which doth but onely carry coals unto the work, can ſhew you by eye three principles of <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> Phyſick. Have you taſted the moſt ſharp Salt, or the moſt ſweet Oil, or the Balm, that moſt delicate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour? All thoſe being hidden in every thing that is created, you have not once perceived. The metalline ſpirits, in whom Phiſick doth conſiſt, by no means can be found out, neither what force they have, or fellowſhip with mans nature, but onely by fire, for as fire did firſt ſhew, that the ſmoak of <hi>Mercury</hi> was poyſon to mans nature without any ſubtill ſpeculation, but thou diddeſt never handle coals, neither canſt draw any ſo ſmall a Balm out of the Vegetals; therefore being ignorant in metalline Phyſick, thou canſt not ſo much as once gueſſe what it is, and therefore doeſt judge of things unknown, as the blind man doth of colours: Is it not a great folly to write againſt a thing, and not to underſtand it well before? Such as are addicted to <hi>Paracelſus</hi> doctrine, when they perceive you have no ſtronger weapons, then thoſe you have hitherto gathered, they will conclude, that you rather confirm and eſtabliſh <hi>Paracelſus</hi> Phyſick, then confute it: It is not enough to ſay a thing is falſe, except there be more probable and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhewed: Hereby it appeareth, that yee nouriſh a ſecret ignorance of naturall things in your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>What, are you thoſe great Phiſitians and excellent Philoſophers? How cometh it then to paſſe, that the force of drugs are hidden and unknown unto you? Doe you not in this point come neer unto the Empericks, whom you with great pride and brag of knowledge reject, when as you ſay, the Chymiſt, be he never ſo excellent, is no Phiſitian, but he that with judgement and reaſon hath learned to make and uſe all remedies for diſeaſes; for in thoſe points conſiſteth the cheifeſt glory and commendation of a Phiſitian, and the onely ſafety of the ſick: How vain is this reaſonable Phiſitian, which prepareth his Medicines with reaſon and not with the hand? He is the very Phiſitian that with his own hand purgeth his Medicines from their venome, and being ſo prepared, with ſharp judgement doth apply them to their proper diſeaſes, that the ſeed of the diſeaſe may be pulled up by the roots, and ſo muſt the ſpeculation and practiſe, reaſon and the work concur and joyn together, becauſe judgement without practiſe is barren. Tell me, how cometh it to paſſe that <hi>Mercury</hi> healeth the French Pox, and the filthy ſcab? Why doe you command the miſerable ſick perſons to annoint themſelves with Quick-ſilver, as Shepheards greaſe their Sheep? How happeneth it (I ſay) that <hi>Mercury</hi> is the ſpeciall beſt remedy againſt theſe diſeaſes? Doe you deny that metals doe any thing, yea, and the greateſt part of theſe cures? Why doe you command ſuch as are infected with Leproſie to ſwallow Gold? Why doe you boil it in broths with Capons? Why doe you mingle leaf Gold in your Pills and Electuaries? You know that the force of the Leproſie is often delayed, that it breaketh not out into the upper part of the skin, by taking of crude Gold into the ſtomack: Then if Gold that is compact and not reſolved doe work this effect, what will not the ſpirit of Gold work being looſed from his groſſe ſubſtance.</p>

This ſaith <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> who ſpeaketh not of ſtamping, but of ſolution: but to what purpoſe doe I alleadge this? Verily, that you may ſee how with your own ſwords you cut your own throats, you uſe Pearles, Corals, and pretious Stones in your Electuaries and broaths, and thoſe you beat into powder. You ſmell as it were a certain Medicinall vertue in precious Stones, but you deal as naughty Cooks &amp; rude Country women doe, that when Partridges or Hares come to their hands, they thruſt them into the pottage pot, or elſe ſeeth them in water: even ſo you ſtamp and break your Pearls, which ſhould rather be diſſolved.

If you will not yet grant, that the ſpeciall cure of diſeaſes conſiſteth in Minerals, hearken what <hi>Andreas Matheolus</hi> ſaith in the fourth book of his Epiſtles; the bodies of the ſick being full of ſeeds of diſeaſes, will hardly be healed without metalline Medicines: and in his Treatiſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Antimony</hi> doth no leſſe purge the diſeaſes of the bodies, then Metals, from ſuperfluities. This did that learned man underſtand, when as yet he knew not the true preparation of <hi>Antimony:</hi> Likewiſe he greatly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the potable Gold, the preparation whereof, as the ſame <hi>Matheolus</hi> uſed it, I will declare unto you, becauſe you ſhall not be ignorant. Take Gold twice or thrice purged with <hi>Antimony,</hi> make it into thinne plates, and in a fit veſſell hang the plates that they touch not one another, and let it be burned and calcined in a Furnace duly prepared by the ſpace of half a year with a very ſtrong fire, untill at the length the plates being taken out and laid open in the air, they doe diſſolve, and there flow from it a certain oily humour, red of colour, and of taſt ſweetiſh. He drew out two ounces of Oil of Gold, but out of that which was not ſo well burnt, the liquor did not ſo readily run out: Sometimes he uſed to poure on the ſpirit of Wine rectified, and that ſo long, and ſo much, untill the whole red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was drawn out.

That Phiſitian uſed firſt to purge the body, and then to ſhave and heat the crown of the head, and then to poure on a drachm of that Oil, and to give ſo much alſo to be drunk in Malmſey.

You ſay, What have you brought to paſſe? what have you found out whereby you ſhould look for praiſe or profit? Then doe we demand of you, What have you found out whereby Phyſick is the better furniſhed? We have brought into Phyſick, Eſſences, Oiles, Balms, and Salts, all which the Alchymiſts ſchools have found out. And how great light is come unto Phyſick onely by true diſtillation, it is known unto all men, and daily experience teacheth, how great commodity hath redounded thereby unto the ſick. In the mean time, if you ſo much deteſt the labour, yet at the leaſt ſpare our good name. But it is no marvell, doth it not ſo alwaies happen, that the beſt labour is worſt accepted and recompenced? Every good man, inclined to vertue, wiſdom, and fidelity, can witneſſe the ſame, what reward they have often received for their fidelity and opening of the truth. So ſome men, when they can ſay no more, they object unto the ſearchers of nature their poverty, filling the eares of the common people with glorious lies, alwaies chanting upon thoſe things which follow upon the abuſe and dangerous cures of the counterfeit <hi>Paracelſians,</hi> judging all things by their contempt, poverty, vile eſtate, and baſeneſſe, but they will quickly avoid that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed poverty, which willingly they ſuſtain, that the nature of things might daily more and more be known unto men, whereby the unaccuſtomed cures of moſt grievous diſeaſes might at length be found out, with the which ſuch as are diſeaſed might through your ſluggiſhneſſe all die, if God, having compaſſion upon them now at the end of the world, had not provided wholſome Medicines, even by moſt contemned men. The Lepers, and Gouty, the infected with the Ptiſick, Falling Sickneſſe, and French Pox, devoured with the Canker, Fiſtula, and greedy Woolf, with the Dropſie, and Palſie, and that with the Plague, and other diſeaſes, are thruſt into their graves: theſe (I ſay) and many other more, whom you through ignorance, with your naughty and corrupt Potions and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatious, like Butchers have buried alive, will riſe up againſt you: theſe (I ſay) will call you to anſwer, and accuſe you, even the poor whom you have robbed of their goods, will require your bloud for the loſſe of their bodies, and conſuming of their money. Then what a madneſſe and cruell fooliſhneſſe is this, that in the time of any great Plague, ſuch as are infected you ſhut up in houſes, ſet marks upon them, keep them in priſon, ſtrangle them with cares and ſolitarineſſe, and kill them for hunger: Is the Plague ſo to be cured? Or whether, doe you not think that all men may be infected from whence the firſt man was infected? why doe you not preſerve the whole with your Antidotes or Defenſives, being ſo famous Phiſitians as you are? but you have tried almoſt all your Medicines to be

O what great puniſhment have you deſerved, that refuſe thoſe that are forſaken of their freinds, farre from their kindred, and as it were thruſt into exile, whoſe ſolitarineſſe hath been more violent unto them then the diſeaſe, and greif of mind hath killed rather then the ſickneſſe?

Every naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian of neceſſity ought to make his Medicines with his own hands, and not to commit them unto an unskilfull Cook, not to fill great volumes with receits, with the which I ſee thoſe that are ſtudious in Phyſick are in a manner over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, that they be ready almoſt to fall down and die under ſo heavy a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of receits, Phyſick is not ſo learned but with the labour of the hands, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe being workmiſtreſſe, where <hi>Vulcan</hi> day by day doth ſhew new and pleaſant remedies which nature teacheth the good ſteward her workman, daily to purge better and better from their ſuperfluities.

Look for knowledge of the ſecret naturall powers, and doe not firſt ſeek it out by labour with the fire? for the moſt part of you all are dainty and ſlothfull, and he that is ſlack in his works, goeth like a blind man unto his practiſe. If you did not ſo much abhor the Chymicall Art, you would learn to ſeparate the pure from the impure (which is the cauſe of the corruption of things) by long digeſtions, diſtillations, and imbibitions, whereby you ſhould make your Medicines pure and clean before you miniſter it to the ſick; ſo upon the ſudden receiving, the ſick nature ſhould be refreſhed, whereas the weak ſtomack cannot concoct, digeſt, and ſeparate groſſe matters. But theſe great Doctors will not be Schollers, or young Souldiers, no more then an old Dog will be brought to hunting with whips, hee'l gnaw his line, and ſhew his grinning teeth to him that leadeth him, rather then he will be ruled; even ſo you will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly gainſay the truth, and like Dogs bark and bite at it, then you will confeſſe your errours.

Proceed therefore with courage, drive away thoſe drones and ſluggiſh beaſts from the rack, ſo ſhall your head be crowned with perpetuall praiſe.

                  <p>At the length, when I had ſufficiently ſearched over the Eaſt Countries, and could gather no certain point in naturall Science, I determined to take my journey towards <hi>Germany,</hi> with the moſt courteous Prince <hi>Cabaneus Vydam</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> ſtill imploying my mind to the earneſt ſtudy of Chymycall Phyſick; and there I underſtood, that Kings and Princes were deceived by unskilfull Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſers, which did utter and ſell their ſophiſticate Chymicall Arts, which they had begged and ſcratched together out of all corners, with a pompous ſhew, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Princes of their money; whereby it cometh to paſſe, that daily a great number of Sophiſters, and ſophiſticators doe daily riſe and ſpring up, through which, not onely the moſt commendable Art of Alchymy receiveth great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is oppreſſed and adulterate, and the Chymiſts themſelves made hatefull unto all men, conſuming their life, time, and goods, upon vain works and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but alſo there redoundeth moſt great hurt and damage unto the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; for there are many deceivers ſo crafty, that with a diſſembled experience in the Chymicall Art, and with fained freindſhip, and great promiſes, they doe craftily learn of others their cunning, which they challenge for their own, eſteem of great value, and carry them about to be ſold.

                  <p>And becauſe that all nations, eſpecially the <hi>Germanes,</hi> have written books in their own language, I will alſo write two books in the French tongue, for the help of ſuch as are ſtudious of Philoſophy, wherein I will treat of many prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and ſpeciall Medicines tried by me and others, alſo of divers Elixars of the Philoſophers, extractions of Mercuries and Mercuriall waters, of many and divers diſſolutions, I will alſo add the interpretations of ſundry Characters, wherewith the books both of the old and new Writers are written to cover and hide the Art; alſo the expoſition of a certain Alphabet, without the which the work can hardly be underſtood: and two Treatiſes, the one of the vertues of the vegetall and minerall Oils, the other of the ſalts and properties of many vegetals and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; whereunto I will alſo joyn two Treatiſes of philoſophicall Mines, and of making of Vinegers, the which my labour and ſtudy, if I ſee it acceptable unto thoſe that are ſtudious of that Art, I will ſhortly ſet forth greater things, which many with their whole hearts doe wiſh and deſire; in the mean time, take in good part this little work. That which we have hitherto ſpoken, is ſpoken onely unto thoſe that doe ſo deadly hate the Chymicall Phyſick, which think nothing can be well or profitably taught in Phyſick that the old Harp ſoundeth not; as though that nature were not more then <hi>Galen,</hi> or that all the learning of Phyſick were to be drawn from the Heathen, or that they alone had publiſhed the Art, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it with ſuch ſound arguments. Why doe you not out of thoſe Authours confute thoſe excellent men which are followers of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> amongſt whom, that great Doctor <hi>Petrus Severinus</hi> a <hi>Dane</hi> is cheif, who in his <hi>Idea</hi> hath opened the invin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why doe you not anſwer to the monarchy of the Trinity, of that learned Doctor and Phiſitian <hi>Gerard Dorne?</hi> Why doe you not confute the volumes of that famous Phiſitian <hi>Turneſſer,</hi> being confirmed with the truth of practiſe? But for your ſakes, which daily call <hi>Galens</hi> doctrine unto examination, and with exact judgement doe conſider of it, giving place unto <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> acknowledging and exerciſing his preparations and practiſe, I doe rejoyce, and ſhortly more ſhall come out againſt the adverſaries, which ſhall bite them better; in the mean time, with your word, deed, and writing, defend the truth from injury.</p>

                  <p>THis Treatiſe of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> (friendly Reader) came unto my hands by the gift of a certaine noble Prince of <hi>Germany,</hi> and becauſe it is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be <hi>Paracelſus</hi> work, I thought it not good to reſerve it to my ſelf, but to publiſh it abroad, ſeeing there cometh no commodity or profit of hidden Treaſure: This therefore, ſuch as it is (loving Reader) imbrace. But this one thing I would have you underſtand, that when you doe miniſter thoſe exalted Eſſences of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and his pretious Oyles, think not that they are to be miniſtred by themſelves, but with ſome other mixture to carry or lead them; and they muſt be uſed, the ſtomack firſt being purged with ſome ſpeciall Medicine of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus?</hi> as for example, if you will miniſter Oil of <hi>Vitrioll,</hi> mingle five or ſix drops with an ounce of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes, ſo ſhall you ſafely give it, the like you muſt judge of other things; uſe theſe happily.</p>

Some things are to bee left for Induſtrious wits, wherein to exerciſe themſelves by ſtudying and ſearching.

In the mean ſeaſon, know thou, that I am not the deviſer of theſe particular things, for ſome of them I had of gift, and ſome other for money and reward came to my hands.

                           <p>NOt onely in theſe our dayes (friend <hi>John</hi>) but alſo in the old time amongſt the learned, this Proverb hath taken place, <hi>That Ignorance is the mother of marvelling:</hi> Who in theſe dayes would not marvell to ſee men utterly void of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of learning, to be preferred before learned men, and ſuch as are moſt skillfull in the Latine and Greek tongues, and thoſe are to be imbraced of Kings and Princes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with moſt liberall gifts, and moſt famous and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men expert in all the tongues to be rejected and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? You, which excell in judgement and learning will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That every perfect gift cometh down from the Father of light.</hi> Therefore God doth in theſe latter daies ſtir up theſe Ideots and Empericks to ſtir up every Phyſitian, that he ſhould rightly prepare his own Medicines with his own hands, and being ſo prepared, with ſharp judgement apply them to their proper diſeaſes, that the ſeed of the diſeaſe may be pulled up by the Roots, and not to commit it to an unskillfull cook. And therefore of neceſſity from hence muſt both the Theorick and the Practiſe, the reaſon and the work concur and joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe judgement without practice is barren. The greateſt number of them will anſwer, we know not your works and preparations which require ſo great and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour, we are now old and Doctors, we will not bee made yonglings, and Schollers again. If this anſwer might take place, the Jew, the Pope and the Turk would not change their ſuperſtitions, which notwithſtanding we know to be moſt contrary to the ſacred Scripture. But we ſufficiently and daily prove by calcining, ſubliming, diſſolving, purifying, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling, congealing and fixing, by this moſt laudable Art of Alchymie, how the pure may be ſeparated from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, and the corruptible from the incorruptible, and that which is venemous and deadly, be changed and made whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45531:225"/>
ſome and good; and as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith concerning this Art, we ſhall firſt conſider that all things are created of God, for he created of nothing ſomething, and that ſomething is the ſeed of all things, and that ſeed worketh that effect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ordained and appointed. All things notwithſtanding are ſo created, that they ſhall come unto our hands, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be in our power, but ſo as things not perfect, but to be made perfect, as things not finiſhed, but to be finiſhed. The matter in them truly is perfect, but the middle and laſt matters remain to de made perfect. As for example, God created Iron, Earth, and Clay, but not ſuch as they ſhould bee, for the clay groweth, yet not like a Pot or other earthen Veſſel: So he created Iron lying in a rude Maſſe, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſo rude unto us, therefore we with our labour muſt make thereof ſhoos for horſes, ſythes, and ſpears. Even ſo is it in Phyſick, for that is alſo created of God, but not ſo that it ſhould be utterly perfect, but as yet hidden under the earth, not purged from his unclean matter, but that which remaineth to be made perfect in it, is committed to the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, that is, to the Phyſitian to be purged and cleanſed. For herbs, trees, ſtones, and iron, and whatſoever is ſeen with the eyes is no true Medicine, but is rude and impure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as yet the pure part lyeth hid. And therefore Alchymy teacheth to purge the Medicine, to diſſolve it, and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate things of contrary kinde from things of the ſame kinde, otherwiſe rotten things would be mingled with rotten, and the corrupt with the corrupt, and ſo conſpire to one effect; ſo that of one diſeaſe many other ſhould ſpring or ariſe. Briefly, every man loveth not that whereof he hath no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding or knowledge, but flieth from it, contemneth it, and thinketh it not meet to be learned. The body onely, careth for that which is outward, but the mind worſhippeth his God. By how much more the knowledge or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing doth increaſe or grow, ſo much the more is the love of the ſame augmented. For all things conſiſt in the true nkowledge of them, and out of that ſprings all the good fruits that redound to knowledge. Knowledge alſo brings faith, for he that knoweth God, beginneth ſtraightway
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45531:225"/>
to put his truſt in him. For ſuch as every mans faith is, ſuch is alſo his knowledge.</p>
                           <p>And contrariwiſe, he that doth otherwiſe work about nature, worketh like a Painter that painteth an Image, in the which is neither life nor ſtrength, wherefore thoſe which you call Empericks ſhall riſe even before your faces, and take in hand and help grievous diſeaſes, the cures whereof are unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto you, and you together with your conſultations and reaſonings ſhall be made laughing ſtocks. As lately <hi>B.</hi> in <hi>Germanie</hi> it happened of a certain noble and famous woman which was vexed with the pain of the Matrix. Some Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſaid it was the gravell and the ſtone, but an Emperick paſſing by, affirmed that it was neither the gravell nor the Stone, wherefore he commanded a Remedy to be prepared for the Matrix, the which being done, ſhe was ſtraightwayes healed. Oh what a rumour was raiſed by and by of him, ſtirring up others alſo to rumours and tales, ſaying, that her husband doth contemn us, that will rather uſe the advice and counſell of an Emperick then ours. Yea, and others that ſeemed wiſer did finally regard him that would every hour uſe the help of an Emperick man moſt unlearned. Mark, I pray you (my friend <hi>Aquilla</hi>) how the enemies inflamed with envie go about to oppreſſe the truth: But at the laſt, will they, nill they, they ſhall be inforced to confeſſe that that cannot be denied. But you may object unto me, He that ſpeaketh all, excludeth nothing. For there be many worthy learned men, Maſters and Profeſſors of Phyſick, that do not deny or refuſe this Art. In the which number are thoſe moſt excellent and ſingular Maſters, and Doctors, <hi>Petrus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verinus Danus</hi> which hath written marvellous things of this Chymicall Art, that worthy and godly man <hi>Michael Neander,</hi> Profeſſor of humanitie, <hi>Theodorus Zuingerus</hi> of <hi>Baſil,</hi> a man practiſed in this Art, and alſo <hi>Theodorus Brickmannus</hi> a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian of <hi>Cullen,</hi> which both by word and deed daily excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with moſt deep judgement in theſe matters, whom I will never overpaſſe with ſilence.</p>

                           <p>AMongſt all things that were created of God, water was the firſt, whereunto God joyned his proper earth, and of earth, whatſoever hath eſſence or life, hath his originall. Therefore there are two manifeſt elements, that is, Water, and Earth; in which the two other lye hid, the Fire in the Earth, and the Aire in the Water: and they are ſo knit together, that they cannot be ſeparated. Two of them are fixed, as the Earth and Fire, two are flying, as Water and Aire. Therefore every element doth participate within other elements. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45531:227"/>
over, in every element are two other elements, one decaying, Putrifying and combuſtible, the other eternall and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the heaven: beſides, in theſe natures lieth hid another nature which is called by the name of ſtinking Pheces, which hinder and take away the ſtrength of the reſt, ſo as they have very little force or none, and thereby make the other elements ſtinking and ſubject to putrefaction. There is alſo two kinds of Waters, the one elementall, the other of rain and river<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters; as there is alſo two kinds of Earths, one elementall, clear, ſhining, and white, the other black, ſtinking, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible. Like as alſo there be two Fires, one elementall and naturall, the other ſtinking and combuſtible; the like is alſo to be ſaid of the aire. The baſe things are ſo mingled with the reſt, that by and by they corrupt all things, ſo that nothing can continue long, for they bring death, and weaken all nature be it never ſo noble. This is to be underſtood of all things both vegetall, animall, and minerall. Therefore it is neceſſary by Art to ſeparate the elementall nature from the corruptible, that the matter may be brought to a medicinall qualitie. There be three moſt ſubtle ſpirits in all things, that is, colour, taſte, and ſmell, theſe fly away inviſibly, the Philoſophers call them wild ſpirits, becauſe they are not fixible, yet the induſtry of the Artificer may fix them. They alwaies grow in the bodily ſubſtance untill they come to perfection and end. The hearb therefore is to be taken when it is fully grown, and take heed that you looſe none of thoſe three ſpirits, as the ignorant uſe to do with their putrifactions and ſeparations of elements. For none of thoſe ſpirits conſiſteth of the three elementall elements: but God hath adorned elements with thoſe three ſpirits, and of them the Fire is animall, the Water, aire ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, and no man, but God can ſeparate them aſunder. But the water of the clouds may be ſeparated from them. Alſo all the feces may be ſeparated from them which are mingled with them, which are the ſtinking and corurptible elements, and the four elementall elements may be brought to a chriſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſhining: but theſe three elements, Fire, Aire, and Earth, are unſeparable. My ſon, know this, that <hi>Mercurie</hi> is the firſt of all things, for before time there was water, <hi>And the ſpirit of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45531:227"/>
Lord reſted upon the water,</hi> but what was that water; the water of the Clouds, or a moiſture which might be poured out? No, but it was a dry duſtie water, and God hath joyned his earth unto it which is his ſulphur, and ſo the earth congealeth the water, and thereof ſprung the four elements included in theſe two, by the will of God. Therefore <hi>Mercurie</hi> congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſulphur, and ſulphur <hi>Mercurie;</hi> neither can one of theſe be without the other, as alſo they cannot be without their ſalt, which is the chiefeſt meanes, by whoſe help nature ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and bringeth forth all vegetals, minerals, and animals. Wherefore theſe three, <hi>Mercury,</hi> Salt, and Sulphur, cannot be one without another, for where the one is found, there the other are found alſo, neither is there any thing in nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe three are not found: and of theſe three, whatſoever is in nature hath his originall, and are ſo mingled with the four elements, that they make one body, and the ſalt is drowned in the bottome of the elements, for it is neceſſary that the ſalt ſhould keep them united by his ſharpneſſe and drineſſe, notwithſtanding it is a flying ſpirit, but becauſe it ſticketh in the bottome of the mixture, and is overcome of the fatneſſe and combuſtible oyle, in which it is found: as the yolk within the white of the egg, and the combuſtible oyle liveth of earth with the ſalt and feces, and the ſalt is buried in the bottome of the feces of the combuſtible oyle and earth, but by great force of fire. Theſe three ſpirits whereof we have ſpoken, are ſaid firſt to be ſeparated from the mixture of the elements, which is the ſoul of all things, or their Quinteſſence, which houldeth together the whole mixture of the elements; for when the ſpirits are gone out, then the mixture is diſſolved by it ſelf and divided, neither is there need of fire to expell the ſalt from the earth; when the elements are ſeparated from the feces, then is the ſalt alſo ſeparated with it. This ſalt is unknown to the ignorant. Therefore ſalt is the meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the groſſe earthly parts, and the three flying ſpirits reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the naturall heat, that is, the taſte, moiſt ſmell, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: which three are the life, ſoule, and quinteſſence of every thing, neither can theſe three ſpirits be one without the other, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are one, yet three
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45531:228"/>
perſons, and one is not without the other. The ignorant laugh, neither underſtand they theſe three ſpirits, when as they are tied to the groſſe, earthly fixed parts, and are made ſubtile, and their ſalt is joyned and mingled with them, it muſt transform them altogether, and fix them into a Criſtaline body, Diaphanes, and red of colour, whereof we will ſpeak hereafter; he that knoweth not this ſalt, ſhall never bring any to paſſe in Art. The Philoſophers call this ſalt a dry water, and a lively ſalt, but the ignorant thought they meant Mercurie, but the Philoſophers called the three ſpirits Mercurie, and the earth Sulphur, which the ignorant underſtand not. Either of them cannot be without the other, neither is there any thing in nature, in which theſe three are not, and they are ſo mixed with the four elements, that they make one body and mixture. Whatſoever God hath created is in theſe three ſtones, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all may be reduced into a Criſtalline clearneſſe by Art, given by God unto the Philoſophers, for in the latter daies God will ſeparate all the unclean feces and corruption that is in the elements, and bring them to a Criſtaline clearneſſe, and redneſſe of a Carbuncle. Afterward there ſhall be no more corruption, but they ſhall endure for ever. Do you think that all things, which God hath created in theſe lower parts, ſhould utterly periſh in the latter day? No, not the leaſt haire of thoſe things which God hath created, no more then the incorruptible Heaven, but God by his Will will change all things, and make them Criſtalline, and the four elements ſhall be perfect, ſimple, and fixed in themſelves, and they ſhall be all a quinteſſence. Demonſtration of theſe things may be made here upon earth by Art, for whatſoever God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may be brought to a Criſtalline clearneſſe, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments gathered together into a ſimple fixed ſubſtance, which being done, no man can alter them, neither the fire it ſelf burn or change them, but they ſhall continue perpetually as thoſe things which have attained eternitie.</p>

But this heaven doth diſtribute and give unto the earth whatſoever is neceſſary for it, although that it ſelf be neither hot nor cold, moiſt nor dry, the which like Effects hath the Quinteſſence of Sugar, the which in it ſelf hath the four Elements, as gold hath: as gold is pure, ſo Sugar is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, gold outwardly is hot and moiſt, inwardly cold and drie, and white: ſugar is the contrary, for it is outwardly cold and dry, and inwardly hot and moiſt and red, and fixed both outward and inward. Neither is there any thing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that the inward qualitie may be brought, that his red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may appear outwardly, and that his Feces be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then is it prepared, and ſhall not need to be fixed, for it is fixed already, and doth retain within it ſelf all outward and inward ſpirits, and whatſoever is Volatile it doth retain.</p>
                           <p>Now what his kinde is I will tell thee, and from whence he hath his Originall, that is, even out of the red, but if thou wilt be further ſatisfied, read the three and thirty chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the generation of thoſe things that grow in the Seas, and other waters, where we write largely of the nature thereof.

Take therefore ten or twentie pounds of Sugar more or leſſe as you ſhall thinke good, that being beaten, put it into a cucurbite of hard ſtone, and put thereon <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae,</hi> that it may ſtand covered eight fingers, then diſtill it in <hi>Balneo</hi> with a ſtrong fire, untill it will diſtill no more, then let it wax cold, and pour on the ſaid <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> again, and diſtill it again, and this ſhalt thou doe ſix or ſeven times; At the laſt open the head and take forth the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, which thou ſhalt put in a ſtrong glaſſe, and ſet it in fine ſifted aſhes, and put thereon the <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and diſtill it untill the half be come forth, then pour on again the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua vitae</hi> which thou diſtilledſt away, firſt being made warm leſt the glaſſe ſhould break; Yee ſhall note, that the head would have a hole in the top, by the which you may pour in the <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> with a Funnell, this thou ſhalt repeat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a ſtrong fire, that the wine and the Sugar may boil in, and becauſe the half part of the wine will come away quickly, ye ſhall preſently put on the other part, for if yee ſhould diſtill forth all the wine, the Sugar would burn through too much heat, becauſe it muſt continually be boyling in the glaſſe, and it would ſmell of the burning, for it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies his combuſtible Sulphur, wherefore ye muſt alwayes have half the wine in the Veſſell, and when thou ſeeſt the half is diſtilled forth, make the ſame warm, and put it in again with a Funnell, and that thou ſhalt ſo often repeat, untill the Sugar remain as red as blood, the which thou ſhalt perceive through the glaſſe. Thou mayeſt bring that to paſſe in eight or ten daies according as thou ruleſt thy fire.</p>
                           <p>Note, that when thou perceiveſt the matter to be red, let
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45531:229"/>

Make thereof a triall, for there will remain nothing but light aſhes; It will burn like oyle or fat, neither doth there any thing remain more then of oile or fat. Take the glaſſe wherein is all the red of the Solution, and diſtill it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> or let it vapour away, if yee have ſtore of diſtilled water, untill it be dry, then let it cool, and take off the head, and pour thereon more ſublimed water, and ſet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> again, and ſtir it about with a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ladle as yee did afore, then let it ſettle as afore, and pour out of the cleareſt part, and that thou ſhalt doe ſo long, till there be no more Feces, then put it in a glaſſe that may abide the fire, and boyl or vapour it away ſo long, till there appear a certain ſcum on it, then take it forth, and ſet it in a cold and drie, or hot and dry place, and it will grow into a great red maſſe or lump, and tranſparent like a Rubie, or other Philoſophers ſtone, which if thou wilt bring to pouder, ſet it in a warm dunghil in a large
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45531:230"/>
wide glaſſe open, and let it vapour away, untill it be come into a yellow pouder like unto gold, and ſo thou ſhalt have the Quinteſſence of Sugar fixt, the which will retain all flying ſpirits. Neither is it ſweet, but a heavenly taſte, the which, if yee put it in your mouth, it will melt without any feeling. If it be winter or cold, thou ſhalt ſeem to feel a certain natural heat throughout the whole bodie, and ſhalt ſeem ſo temperate and light, as though thou couldſt flie. If thou be over-hot, ſwallow a little, and preſently thou ſhalt cool eaſily, as though thou wenteſt into a cold bath, and thus it worketh in heat, moiſt, cold, and dry, by an incredible Miracle: When yee will uſe it, drinke it with rectified <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or Roſe-water, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive or Scabios, or by it ſelf if ye will, and thou ſhalt ſee marvels: If any be diſeaſed outwardly with Scabs or Ulcers, let him drinke of this, and waſh the ſores with Wine, wherein this Quinteſſence is diſſolved, and he ſhall preſently wax whole moſt mraculouſly. If any be wounded or thruſt in with any weapon, ſo that it be not deadly, let him drinke <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. of this Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with warmed Wine, and waſh the Wound with Wine, wherein the Quinteſſence is diſſolved, he ſhall be preſently cured, ſo that thoſe which ſhall hear or ſee it ſhall be ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed thereat. It helpeth alſo the falling ſickneſſe, peſtilence, and all ſuch diſeaſes as may happen unto man; if yee have <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> yee ſhall mix <abbr>lb</abbr> ii. with <abbr>lb</abbr> i. of this Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in a glaſſe, and ſet it on a Trivet, or in a dry <hi>Balneo</hi> 30 dayes in an <hi>Athanor,</hi> and they will be fixt together, and then it will work miracles in mans bodie; ye may alſo when you have drawn the Quinteſſence of any hearb, coagulate and fix it with the ſame, as I ſaid before with <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> and thou ſhalt ſee thereof Miracles. Furthermore if ye will have it to paſſe the helm, yee muſt put thereon as much Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar or <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and diſtil it, and again pour on freſh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar or <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and draw it away again untill the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence doth aſcend in a red golden colour, as we have ſhewed in many places, how to diſtill thoſe matters that are fixed by Vinegar, or <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> for when it is diſtilled by the Limbeck, his vertues are augmented a thouſand times, and will work ſtrange cures: keep this as a ſecret, for it is a great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in nature.</p>

                           <head>Here beginneth a manuall or handy work, how the Quinteſſence may be drawn out of Honey.</head>
                           <p>NOw will I open unto you a great Secret in the Vegetall work of honie, to wit, a marvellous nature, for it is drawn out of the moſt noble and pure part of the floures. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bees is ſuch, that they draw out the beſt of every thing, as in the Animall work is more at large deſcribed, wherein there is taught how to extract the nature of all beaſts, and ſpeciallly in the 84. Chapter. Wherefore (my ſon) know this, that all that God hath created good in the upper part of the world, are perfect and uncorruptible, as the heaven: but whatſoever in theſe lower parts, whether it be in beaſts, fiſhes, and all manner of ſenſible creatures, hearbs or plants, it is indued with a double nature, that is to ſay, perfect, and unperfect; the perfect nature is called the Quinteſſence, the unperfect the Peces or dreggs, on the venemous or combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible oile. Therefore you ſhall ſeparate the dregs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible oyle, and then that which remaineth is perfect, and is called the Quinteſſence, which will endure continually, even as the heaven, neither can it be diſſolved with fire or any other thing. For when God had created all things, and looked upon them, they were all perfect good, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lacking to any; and therefore for loves ſake I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that God hath put a ſecret nature or influence in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature, and that to every nature of one ſort or kind he hath given one common influence, and to every one of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall kinds their ſeverall influence and vertue, whether it bee on Phyſick, or other ſecret works, which partly are found out by naturall workmanſhip. And yet more things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known then are apparant to our ſenſes: What! doe you not think that an hearb that is appointed for one diſeaſe, which it will cure, doth not contain in it many more vertues then are known unto us? Yes truly many more. This alſo I adde, that if the Feces and combuſtible oyle be taken away from this thing or hearb, which in all things is the poiſon that ſhould be taken away, that brings death unto us, and the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45531:231"/>
Elements ſhould be purified, and ſo burned together by Art, that they ſhall paſſe together by a Limbeck, and be joyned together, as it were coupled in marriage, that it may root out all manner of diſeaſe from every thing, be it hearb or living thing, or be drawn from his venome, as in the 14. Chapter of the Prologue of this Book is declared, and alſo in the Prologue of the Animall work, whereas the manner of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Quinteſſence out of all venemous beaſts, birds, worms, and flies, is plainly declared, that it may help all the griefs of man, but that ſpecially is drawn out of the bloud of man, and there is likewiſe declared, that there is no need of things without man or beaſt to help ſuch as are infected. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature contains in himſelfe the remedy of his diſeaſe, which remedie may be drawn without the hurt of man or beaſt, that the diſeaſe may be miraculouſly cured, as is there moſt excellently taught in the Theorick and in the Practick. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would write this, that thou ſoon mighteſt underſtand what marvellous force is in Honey, which is taken out of all floures, and gathered into one Maſſe, which truly is indued with ſundry Vertues. For if God hath given unto other things the gift of healing, what then is there not in Honey, which is gathered out of ſo many floures, and every hearb indued with his own proper Vertue? Truly if it be brought to his height and excellencie, it will work marvellouſly. Now conſider what lieth hidden in this Quinteſſence, and eſteem it not lightly, but keep it ſecret as the moſt excellent thing of all the Animal work, the which being obtained, you ſhall need no other Medicines to put away all the accidents of the bodie.</p>

                              <p>NOw I will ſet in hand with the practiſe. Take twelve quarts of the beſt Virgin Honey, and put it in a great earthen Veſſel with a Limbeck well luted, and ſet it in <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> and lute a Recipient to the neck of it, and diſtill that which will diſtill of it in your <hi>Balneo</hi> boyling. My ſon, know this, that there is no common water in Honey, but onely
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45531:231"/>
Philoſophicall and Elementall, for the element of Aire doth firſt paſſe with the element of fire, in the which the aire is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the aire when it riſeth, reſembleth the ſavour of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> diſtilled, and at the firſt can not be known from <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> neither by ſight, neither by ſavour: diſtill it untill there will no more ariſe, then leave the veſſell in <hi>Balneo</hi> five daies with a Limbeck and receiver, let it boyl night and day, that the matter may be dried, then let it cool, and take it out, and take away the receiver and Limbeck, and that which is in the receiver pour into the veſſel again upon the dry matter, and ſet it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and cover the mouth of the veſſel with a clean diſh well luted, and let your <hi>Balneum</hi> be onely luke warm. My ſon, underſtand that it may thus be done, for it is good that the fire be drawn with his proper aire, ſo as a man would ſtay ſo long, for it would be of the greater force. The ancient Philoſophers wrought in this ſort, but the danger is, when the veſſels ſhall be opened leaſt the water fly away, for it is as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till as wine. For every time the aire is to be drawn away, and againe to be poured on, making putrifaction in a warm <hi>Balneo,</hi> but firſt it muſt be well luted, and a Limbeck being ſet on with a receiver, you muſt reiterate the work, untill the fire riſe like unto red bloud. There is another methode or rule of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found out in theſe our daies, which is in this ſort.</p>

Then take a clean veſſell and pour out that which is clear, and pour upon the feces freſh diſtilled water, as you did before, and ſet the veſſell in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and do as you did before: let it be cleared and put aſide with the firſt water, and put on againe freſh water diſtilled, and ſet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> as

Then take your earth, and calcine it in a furnace of reverberation gently, untill it be all white as ſnow, then take a great earthen or ſtone veſſell, and put your white calcined earth into it, and pour out a good quantity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water diſtilled, and ſtir it with a wooden ladle, and ſet it three daies in a boyling bath, and cover it with a diſh, and ſtir it every day ten or twelve times.

                              <p>NOw my Son, if thou wilt bring this Quinteſſence yet to a greater perfection: Take a great Circulatory, or Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45531:233"/>
that is, a glaſſe that hath a great head like to a <hi>Limbeck,</hi> and in the top of the head a hole, by the which the matter may be poured in by a Funnell; let the hole be ſtopped; out of the head cometh forth two armes bending round unto the belly, by the which that which doth aſcend up may fall down again by thoſe armes of glaſſe into the belly of the Pellican: This is the form of the Veſſels that diſtill one into another, or Pellican. 1. Take then your Quinteſſence, and put it in a Pellican in aſhes, but better in ſalt prepared and dried, and make your fire like unto the extream heat in Summer, and the Quinteſſence will riſe like unto a red Oil, and fall down again by the armes of the Pellican; and by often aſcenſion, the Quinteſſence will wax thick, that it will tarry in the bottom and riſe no more; then fortifie the fire that it may aſcend and deſcend again; then keep the fire in that heat untill it aſcend no more, but reſt in the bottom; then make your fire ſtronger, that it may aſcend and deſcend again, and keep the heat in the ſame degree untill it riſe no more. 2. Obſerve this manner in augmenting your fire untill the water be fixed, and the glaſſe be red hot four and twenty houres together; if the Quinteſſence doe not then aſcend, it is fixed, and brought unto his higheſt vertue; and take it out of the glaſs, being yet hot, for if it be cold, it will wax hard, ſo that you muſt break the glaſſe; for at the fire it doth wax liquid, and being ſet open in the air, it doth congeal, and peirceth every hard thing, as Oil doth any dry leather, and in colour is like unto a Rubie, and through ſhining like a Chriſtall, it giveth light in the dark, ſufficient to read by. What doeſt thou think of this my Son? are there not many ſtrange bodies created of God? Truly he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Philoſophers with no leſſe gifts; for they that can look into the ſecrets of nature, ſhall ſee it to be of an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible operation, for this is gathered by the Bees of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſt part of all Plants, Trees, Floures, and Fruits, and at that time, when Floures break out and Trees bud. It is worthily called the Philoſophers ſtone, for it is fixed and liquable as Wax, and as the minerall ſtone tranſmuteth the impure metall, ſo doth this alter diſeaſes. Hereby it doth appear, that this doth bear the bell amongſt all vegetals; whereas it being yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45531:234"/>
in his groſeneſſe and impute, it is but of ſmall value for any uſe in Phyſick, by what means ſo ever it be boiled or ſcummed, but doth alwayes retain his nature; for it conſiſteth of all the fruits of the earth, plants, and trees: Whereof one hearb is hot, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cold, another dry, another moiſt, one aſtringent, another laxative, ſome corroſive, others venomous; and ſo divers hearbs have their divers qualities. 3. It cometh to paſſe, if it help one diſeaſe, by and by it hindereth another; for every thing worketh according to his property, when as there is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made in the body; and of this ſeparation it ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth bloud and other humours: And they are likened unto Gunpowder, which ſo long as it lieth ſtill there cometh no hurt of it, but if it be brought unto the fire, it ſtrait uttereth his ſecret nature, and is kindled with a venomous fire, which cannot be quenched with water; for the cold and dry, hot and moiſt, doe ſtrive amongſt themſelves, a wind is ſtirred up, that breaketh all things that is near unto it. The like happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto Honey, that when it cometh to the region of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that it ſhould be there ſeparated, then it ſheweth his nature to paſſe up, and ſwell with wind, that it is no marvell, if that through contention the veins of the Liver be broken, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happeneth, whereupon Impoſthumes are cauſed in divers places, and bringeth forth ſuch inflammations, that the veines are eaſily broken; although many doe greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Honey, but they are not the children of Philoſophy, neither doe they underſtand the nature of it: But when it is brought to a ſimple, fixed as Wine, then is it the cheifeſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine amongſt all the vegetables, neither is the like unto this found in all the world. Give God thanks, and be liberall unto the poor. The doſe of this is one grain, and it muſt be taken every morning with an empty ſtomack, likewiſe in the evening, untill the end of the diſeaſe. For every diſeaſe will be cured in ſhort time, even after the ſame manner, as the Minerall ſtone maketh his projection upon metals: Praiſe God, and labour diligently.</p>

                           <head>The manner and order how to draw the Quinteſſence out of the Hearb, called <hi>Roſe ſolis.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>NOw my Son, I will teach thee the greateſt myſtery or ſecret amongſt all vegetable things, whoſe force and ſtrength hath been kept ſecret amongſt all the antient work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and they have bound themſelves one to another by Oath, that they ſhould not utter, in their books or writings, the ſtrength of this Hearb, which is called <hi>Roſe ſolis,</hi> and in the Germane tongue <hi>Sindawe.</hi> Whoſoever therefore hath not the whole vegetable work, he cannot attain to the ſtrength of this Hearb; for in that work is comprehended all the force of medicinall things: And this work of vegetables is not come to the hands, but onely of the antient ſworn Artificers, which were skilfull in the liberall Arts. But now my Son, I will open it unto thee with adjuration, that thou ſhalt keep this hidden knowledge ſecret. Firſt, my Son, you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this Hearb is the Hearb of the Sun, upon the which the Sun ſpreads his beames and influences, as he doth upon Gold in the veines of the Mines; and he poureth out his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences more upon this Hearb, then upon any other which is created of God, as it is evidently known of the antient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and this Hearb doth ſo farre ſurmount all other Hearbs which ſpring out of the earth, as the Sun doth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Planets in the Heaven, and hath greater force and power of influence then any other thing created of God in the Firmament. So this hearb doth excell all others in vertue, and therefore this hearb is decked with another colour, other leaves, and ſtranger ſhape then all other hearbs. And his nature is ſuch, that the hotter and drier the country is in the time of the year, and the heat of the Sun, and the more that the Sun doth heat and burn him, this hearb is the more moiſt and filled with dew, inſomuch, that upon one branch will hang above a thouſand drops. Make a triall, and ſtrike this hearb with a ſlender twig, that the drops which fall from it may fall into a large glaſſe veſſell, and you ſhall ſee the veſſell filled with a marvellous dew, and if the Sun be vehement hot, thoſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45531:235"/>
branches in ſhort ſpace, that is, within the ſpace of half an hour will be more full of dew then before, and if you ſtrike the dew twentie times with a rod, yet it will again bee laden with drops; it were enough if wee did ſee no other miracle then from whence this dewie humour ſhould riſe, which in ſo ſhort ſpace doth ſo abundantly flow from it, and how much the more the burning ſun doth ſcorch up the other hearbs, ſo much the more is this moiſt, and filled with drops, even as though it had been ſprinkled over with water, hereupon may we gather his marvellous qualities, and judge that there is ſome ſecret operation hidden in it; if thou do keep this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thus gathered in a glaſſe, therewith thou ſhalt cure all the diſeaſes of the eyes, whether they come of Rheums, or of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation: It helpeth moreover all the pains and diſeaſes of the heart, it cooleth the Liver, and ſtomack that is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and doth mitigate all the pain of the head that cometh of heat, and driveth away all dreams and Phantaſies: It is good alſo to kill the Canker and the Wolf, againſt the biting of Venemous beaſts, againſt Poiſon drunke, if it be taken by the mouth, it helpeth alſo the Peſtilence, it is good for many other diſeaſes which were too long here to rehearſe.</p>
                           <p>This hearb hath the colour of the ſun, for his colour is red dark, divided with yellow lines, and his ſhape is like a Star, and his proportion like a heavenly Planet, and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of ſeven branches, in the outward part broad, neer the ground narrow, and it is as though it were heavie, of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſubſtance, outwardly hot and moiſt, inwardly cold and dry. The left ſide of it is cold and moiſt, the right ſide hot and dry, and it is moſt temperate as gold. Wherefore his Elements cannot be ſeparated one from another as in other hearbs, but it may be purged from his Feces, for his fixing letteth that the Elements cannot be ſeparated, for the fire will aſcend with the aire by the <hi>Balneum,</hi> as we will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teach. The earth may be ſeparated from his Feces, and the Feces likewiſe from the fire and aire, although it hath not many dregs. Some Latine Writers call it <hi>Lingua avis,</hi> or Birds-tongue; ſome call it <hi>Solaria</hi> of the Sun, of <hi>Lunaria</hi> it is called the Moon; the Fleming calls it <hi>Sindow.</hi> But the old
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45531:235"/>
Philoſophers have kept ſecret the qualities as yet for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous effect it worketh. And it is marvell, ſaith <hi>Arnoldus de Villa nova</hi> that a man ſhould die that eateth every day ſome of it in his groſſe ſubſtance, what will it then work when it is brought unto his fineneſſe, and cleanſed from his Feces? It hath this great vertue in it, that if it be put into a glaſſe, wherein there is poiſon mingled with wine, or any other cup that is poiſoned, ſtraightwayes the glaſſe will flie in Pieces, but if it be a ſtone pot of Alabaſter, or ſuch like, the Wine will ſo boil, as though there were a violent fire under it, and all the wine will run out untill there be nothing left in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: Alſo if any man carrie this hearb about him, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen on his enemies, they ſhall have no power to hurt, but contrariwiſe to ſhew him all kind of dutie. Alſo if any man bee bewitched either in bodie, or in his art, that is in Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie, Brewing, or Baking, or by any other meanes, this hearb carried about him makes him free from the witchcraft. If it be alſo tyed upon the belly of a woman with child, ſhe ſhall ſtraightwayes be delivered, although the childe were dead and rotten within, as it hath been oftentimes proved by experience. This hearb carried about one, or a little there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of every day eaten as long as it is uſed, preſerveth a man from the Falling Sickneſſe. Moreover, if a man be taken with the Apoplexie, that his mouth be drawn aſide, and his ſpeech and ſenſes taken from him, they ſhall be all reſtored again, if the ſick drinke the juyce of this hearb ſtreined, as hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes proved. Moreover if it be hanged about the neck of one that is poſſeſſed of a ſpirit, ſo long as he carrieth that about him, he ſhall be quiet as a Lamb, and the power of the ſpirit ſhall be taken away. Make a proof, and you ſhall find it true. The bleeding at the noſe is by and by ſtayed, if you hold that hearb in your mouth. They that are wearied with travell, if they drink the juyce thereof in wine, they are by and by ſo refreſhed, as if they had not laboured or gone no journey, it doth comfort the Sinews, Muſcles, Tendons, and all the whole nature. Wounds are alſo cured therewith, if it be drunk ten daies together in Wine or Ale, if the wound be waſhed with the ſame drinke, and bound up with a cloth wet in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45531:236"/>
ſame. The pain of the teeth, is by and by appeaſed, if that hearb be laid unto it. All theſe things have been often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and found true. If it will doe ſuch things whileſt it is yet hindred with his groſſe matter, what will it work when it is brought to his perfection? My Son, know this for a truth that there is no hearb that grows upon the earth to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto this in ſtrength and goodneſſe, therefore take heed that you doe not neglect it, but diligently remember and keep the ſecret cloſe from them that are not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our children, and from the ignorant. For if this hearb did not grow ſo plentifully, and the properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were known, it would be more eſteemed then gold or precious ſtones, for the Effects of the Quinteſſence are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, as hereafter ſhall appear.</p>
                           <p>Now there remaineth that we muſt teach how to bring this hearb to his higheſt degree, and to his Quinteſſence. Firſt, it is to be gathered, the ſame having his courſe in his own houſe, that is in the Lion, and the Moon behold him with a ſiniſter quadrate Aſpect. It is to be gathered whole, with roots, leaves and floures, ſo that there be neither earth, dirt, nor other hearbs mingled withall. Neither muſt it by amy means touch any water or be made moiſt. Therefore you muſt take heed that you gather it not in rainie weather, or moiſt weather: but rather when the Sun doth ſhine hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt upon it, gather great ſtore of it, and ſtamp it well in a morter of Marble, and put it in a <hi>Cucurbite</hi> of ſtone with a head and receiver luted, and ſet it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and diſtil away all the water, untill it be ſo dry like pouder, and there will riſe together with the water of the colour of moſt fine gold, which onely happeneth in this hearb, and in none other, and when there remaineth no more liquor, yet leave the cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite for three or four dayes in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and boil it night and day that all the moiſture may be perfectly ſeparated and drawn away, then let it cool, and take away the receiver, and ſtop it diligently, then take off the head, and take out the matter and beat it in a Marble morter into moſt fine powder that it may paſſe through a thick ſieve, put this pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again into an earthen cucurbite, and pour on your water
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45531:236"/>
and aire, and ſtir it with a woodden ladle, and cover the mouth of the cucurbite cloſe with a tile, and ſet it in a warm bath by the ſpace of nine dayes to putrifie, every day ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with a wodden ladle four or five times, and cover the cucurbite again with a tile, ſetting a weight of lead upon it, at the nine dayes end take your veſſel out of the <hi>Balneo,</hi> and that which is in it, ſtrein it into an earthen veſſell glaſed, and ſtrein it hard untill the matter drie. Then take this dry pouder, and put it into his cucurbite, and cover it with a tile, and keep it in a warm place untill I teach you what you ſhall doe with it.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The moiſt liquor which is drawn from it will be red, for the Element of fire is there preſent with the air and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, put that liquor into a cucurbite of ſtone, and put on a head, and lute it well, and ſet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> with a Receiver well luted, and diſtill away all the water, with the air ſeverally from the fire in a boyling bath, until there will no more diſtil, and the fire will paſſe away in the bottome, then take away the veſſel out of the bath and ſtop it well untill I teach thee what is further to be done.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Then take again the ſtone cucurbite wherein your pouder is contained, which I bad you before to keep, and pour on the fire and the aire, and ſtir it well with a wooden ladle, and ſet it in a warm bath nine dayes more, and cover it with a tile, and ſtir it four or five times every day with a ladle as you did afore. And when the nine daies are paſt, ſtrein out that which is in the Veſſel, and pour the liquor into a glaſed veſſel, the reſidue of the pouder put into another veſſel, as you did before, and keep it ſo long untill I teach thee how to draw out the combuſtible oyle.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Then take again the Veſſel wherein your fire is, and mingle your liquor with it which you keep in your glaſed veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, where your fire and aire is, and ſet a head upon the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel where your matter is, and lute it, and ſet it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and ſet a receiver to the bill of the head, then diſtill out the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and air with a boyling bath until no more will diſtill, and you ſhall have in the receiver water and aire, take them away, and take the Veſſel out of <hi>Balneo,</hi> and you ſhall find remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bottome like thick Turpentine, and that is the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45531:237"/>
of fire mingled with many Feces. Now the fire is to be ſeparated from the Feces in this manner, pour on your wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and aire upon that from whence you draw it, and ſtir it with a ſpoon, and cover it with a tile, and let it ſettle four dayes, and the Feces will fall into the bottome, and pour out ſoftly that that is clear into a clean cucurbite, that no Feces paſſe; withall ſtop the Veſſel wherein the Feces are, and ſet it by. But that Veſſel that containeth the water fire, and aire, ſet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> with a head and receiver fitted and well luted, and diſtill the water and aire in that ſame degree. And when it will diſtill no more, take away the receiver: Let the veſſel cool, and you ſhall find in the bottome your fire, which keep in his veſſel well ſtopped, and pour in your water and aire again upon the Feces, from whence you did draw them, and ſtir them with a ſpoon, and let it ſettle four dayes, then pour it out ſoftly from his Feces into the veſſell that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your fire, ſo that no Feces be mingled withall, cover your veſſell wherein your Feces remain, and ſet it up. But your Veſſel, wherein your water, air, and fire, is ſet again in <hi>Balneo</hi> as I ſhewed you, and diſtill away the water and aire, for they two doe alwaies paſſe away together, and the fire remaineth in the bottome. Pour on the water and air again upon the Feces, and ſtir it with a ſpoon, then let it ſettle four dayes, (this is now the third repetition, whereby you have ſeparated the water and aire from the Feces,) and that which is clear pour out into the Veſſel that holdeth your fire. Then put your Feces unto the firſt which I bad you keep, in the which your combuſtible oyle is. For now you have drawn your fire out of your Feces: therefore diſtill your water with the air, and when it will diſtill no more, take away your Veſſell, and you ſhall finde in the bottome the Element of fire not yet pure, but foul and full of dregs, pour on therefore the water and air again, and ſtir it well with a ſpoon or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, cover it, and let it ſtand, and ſettle four dayes, then pour out that which is clear into another clean veſſel, and ſet aſide the Veſſel wherein your Feces are. But the Veſſel wherein your fire, water, and oyle are, ſet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> to diſtill as long as it will diſtil, then take it out, and pour the liquor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45531:237"/>
into the veſſell where your feces are, and doe as I taught you to work with the feces, untill you have your element of fire without any feculent or groſſe ſubſtance.</p>
                           <p>When you have diſtilled away the water and air from the fire, and ſuffered it to ſettle four dayes, and that all be clear without any feces, then ſhall you have your pure fire. Therefore put all your feces together unto your firſt feces, where your combuſtbile oyle is. Afterward take a great Cucurbite of glaſſe, and put all your three Elements into it, and ſet it in aſhes with a Limbeck and a Receiver fitted and luted, and kindle a gentle fire, firſt in your furnace, and increaſe it more and more, untill the fire and air be paſſed, and that your Limbeck begin to wax red within. Then make the heat of your fire moderate, untill all your element of fire be paſſed, and the head red like bloud, and the water and air ſhall ſwim upon it like oyle: by this meanes theſe three Elements ſhall be brought to their higheſt eſſence, and be perfectly rectified. Take away the Receiver, and ſtop it diligently, untill your earth be prepared, and know, that in the duſt and feces there remaineth yet a combuſtible oyle, which you may extract by a diſcenſory, if you will. It is good againſt the cold Gout, for Members benom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and Sinews too much mollified. If thou be weary of this labour, put this powder or feces into a reverberatory, that they may be mingled with a gentle fire, untill it be as white as ſnow; which being done, put it into a large cucurbite of ſtone, and pour on a great quantity of water twice diſtilled, it is not materiall how much water you pour on, and ſtir it well with a woodden ladle or ſpoon five or ſix times, alwayes cover it diligently with a tile, and after four dayes ſuffer it to cool, and let it ſtand four dayes and ſettle, then pour out the cleer from the feces warily into another clean veſſell, and pour on freſh diſtilled water as before, ſtir it with your ſpoon, and keep it two dayes in <hi>Balneo</hi> as before, then ſuffer it to cool and ſettle, and pour out the clear from the feces, and put it to the firſt water; doe this the third time, and then caſt away the feces, for they are good for nothing: All your waters that you have drawn, diſtill by <hi>Balneo,</hi> or, for the more ſpeed, by aſhes, that all the water may riſe, and that there remain in the bottome a duſty matter, pour on diſtilled water again, ſtir it, and keep it in <hi>Balneo</hi> by the ſpace of four and twenty houres,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45531:238"/>
then let it cool and ſettle, and pour out that which is clear gently from the feces: Poure on again more common water upon them, and ſtir it, ſet it in <hi>Balneo</hi> ten or twelve houres, take it out, let it ſettle, and poure the clear unto the firſt water, and caſt away the feces, they are nothing worth. Repeat this work ſo often, untill there remain no feces after it hath ſetled. Then ſhall you have your earth rectified from all his feces, which you ſhall congeal and dry, that it may be like powder or duſt: Then joyn that with your other elements in the glaſſe, and it will ſtraight reſolve into his element, for the element of water is there preſent: ſet them all together in a furnace upon aſhes, put on a Head with a Receiver well luted; the head muſt have a hole in the top, that with a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell the liquour may be poured in, and alwayes ſtopped ſafely. Make your fire in your furnace firſt gentle, afterward greater, untill that, that is fermented, doe paſſe; but all is not to be drawn out, but about half a ſextary of the liquour with the water, that the matter may remain moiſt; for if you ſhould drive out all, it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geale into an hard maſſe, and break the glaſſe in the furnace. Then open the hole which is in the top of the Head, and with a funnell poure in that which is in the Receiver; but firſt it muſt be made warm, leaſt by pouring in the cold liquour the glaſſe doe break, but if you ſuffer the glaſſe to cool, you may poure it in without any danger. Repeat this inbibition ten or twelve times, afterward diſtill out whatſoever will be diſtilled, ſo long as any thing will paſſe by the neck of the Limbeck: For after this tenth diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the earth will be no more congealed, but will reſt in the bottome like a red golden Oil. Inbibe it again, pouring on the liquour, and diſtilling it untill all the elements paſſe together by the Limbeck, and that nothing at all doe remain in the bottome of the veſſell. Then give thanks to God for his marvellous gifts, which he hath diſtributed unto his Philoſophers, and hath given them ſo great knowledge of things as they uttered in this work, which is altogether heavenly, and rather divine then humane: For it is a great marvell in this life, that mans underſtanding can bring theſe inferiour things to ſo great perfection that they have attained, even to the higheſt degree of vertue. Truly it is the work of the Holy Ghoſt, which hath put it into the mindes of men. For I doe affirm, that whoſoever hath this hearb ſo prepared, that he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45531:238"/>
may help all the infirmities of mans body, whether they be curable or uncurable, except naturall death, which is ordained before unto every man of God. Yea, this I dare be bold to ſay, that if a man doe uſe daily the weight of one ſcruple of this Quinteſſence, or the Quinteſſence of Sugar, and potable Gold, wherein Pearles are diſſolved, or the Quinteſſence of Selan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, that man by Gods help ſhall not die before the day of the great judgement; for the humours in mans body can by no meanes predominate one over another, as in the thirty ſix Chapter of Vegetals is taught, where is treated of the Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence of all Medicinall things, and there it is ſhewed, that by Gods help the life of man may be prolonged even untill that day, void and free from all diſeaſes and ſickneſſe. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that man may be preſerved in the ſtate he was in at thirty yeares of age, and in the ſame ſtrength and force of wit; and upon that doe all the Philoſophers agree, that a man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame ſtate as long as in an earthly Paradiſe. This is ſo plainly and at large ſhewed in that Chapter, that will you, nill you, you ſhall be inforced to conceive it in your mind to beleeve it, and to confeſſe it to be true: Therefore it is not needfull to reaſon much of the force and qualities of this Quinteſſence, but whatſoever diſeaſe a man be infected withall, give him to drink with Wine ſo much of this Quinteſſence as a nutſhell will hold, and in ſhort ſpace he ſhall be healed, as it were miraculouſly, according as the diſeaſe is, violent or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. But if you give this Quinteſſence to drink, mixed with the Quinteſſence of Sugar, with potable Gold, wherein Pearles are diſſolved, and with the Quinteſſence of Selandine, within one day you ſhall cure all the diſeaſes whatſoever they be; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doth appear, that it is rather a divine work then humane. Therefore give God the praiſe, and take heed that you doe not utter this ſecret, for Tyrants would by that means prolong their lives, that they might bring to paſſe their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, whereof both you and I ſhould be the occaſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep it ſecret, for it is one of the greateſt ſecrets amongſt all the vegetals, whereunto no treaſure may be compared. Work therefore, and diſtribute liberally unto the poor, and God ſhall give thee eternall felicity.</p>

doe teſtifie) as the force of their ſpirits, which may be called, as it were, their ſoules. But peradventure ſome of thoſe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters will ſay, why are not we content with thoſe Medicines and Remedies, which the learned Antiquity hath delivered unto us, and that <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Gallen,</hi> the antient Pillars of our Art, and others, have ſet forth in their Monuments? why ſeek we new wayes never heard of before, eſpecially unknown to the Apothecaries? But ſome of us will anſwer, that the onely remedy of <hi>Mercury</hi> precipitate, is the onely remedy (to paſſe over other) which very lately they have begun to uſe in curing of Wounds by gun-ſhot, and other maligne Ulcers, were ſufficient to anſwer this their queſtion, yea, and to reprove their folly joyned with intollerable pride. But if authority be asked for, I think <hi>Geſner, Guinter, Andernack, Severine,</hi> (to paſſe over a great many other) will be for us of great authority with the learned, as theſe ſlanderers; eſpecially, becauſe the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe famous men is confirmed by their learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Monuments, that thoſe tongues might count it a great honour unto them, to confeſſe themſelves their Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. It were eaſie for me to bring forth many other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if I did not ſee the folly of theſe back-biters to be ſo great, whereof truly I am aſhamed, eſpecially when I behold ſome of their books lately ſet forth, wherein, contrary to the purpoſe of the Treatiſe, ſtrange things are inforced, that (as the old Proverb ſaith) the ointment ſeemeth to conſiſt in nothing, as though they pertain to the purpoſed treating of curing the Gout, certain invective digreſſions I know not what of the beginning of things, of the originall of metals and Philoſophers ſtone (which of them is called <hi>Moroſophocus</hi>) or did in any point ſeem to agree with it. Therefore again and again I am inforced to cry out, O happy Arts, if onely Artificers might judge of them. How farre unlike was the purpoſe of many old men, the which if they were ignorant of any thing, which they underſtood was known of others, even in farre diſtant Countries, they ſpared no labour to goe ſee them. <hi>Plato</hi> inflamed with deſire to learn thoſe things which he knew not, went into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and after to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitas,</hi> and over all <hi>Italy,</hi> to hear the other Pythagorical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45531:240"/>
                              <hi>Apollonius Tyanius</hi> travelled through the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and paſſed over the Mountain <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and viſited the <hi>Albanes, Scythians, Maſſagets,</hi> and all the rich king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>India;</hi> afterwards was carried unto the <hi>Brachmanes,</hi> and heard <hi>Jarehas</hi> in his chaire of gold diſputing of the hidden cauſes of things, and of the hidden myſteries of nature; from thence by the <hi>Elamites, Babylonians, Chaldees, Medes, Aſſiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Paleſtines,</hi> he returned to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and from thence went into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to hear the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> and to learn their ſecret and hidden Arts. This vertue is truly to be followed, and not the ſluggiſhneſſe of thoſe ſlouthful fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, which having ſcarce once moved their foot from their country fires, yet will diſallow this Spagerick Art, and think no further labour to be taken in ſearching of the truth, when notwithſtanding, that Art doth make open unto us the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous and hidden ſecrets of nature; neither in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are they unworthily contemned of thoſe, which with their manifold perils and travels have ſought out thoſe ſecrets of nature. But, I pray you, what fooliſhneſſe is this, to forbid us to uſe any other Medicines, then thoſe which were known in old time? As though Rhabarbe, then which no Medicine is more in uſe this day, then were known to the old Phiſitians: Further, to what purpoſe is it, that they object unto us the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phury metalline venomous ſtinks (as they call them) by whoſe ſmell and drawn breath (for theſe are their contumelious words) they be almoſt ſtrangled that come into the dens of thoſe <hi>Cyclops?</hi> But is it unknown unto thoſe ſlanderers and Sycophants, that the old Phiſitians made very many Medicines of moſt filthy things, as of the filth of the eares, ſweat of the body, of womens menſtrues (and that which is horrible to be ſpoken) of the dung of man and other beaſts, Spittle, Urine, Flies, Mice, the aſhes of an Owles head, the hoves of Goats and Aſſes, the Wormes of a rotten tree, and the ſcurfe of Mules, as may be gathered out of the Writings of <hi>Galen, Aëtius, Aegineta, Dioſcor. Marcel. Plin. Serap.</hi> to paſſe the metallines, which it is evident they did alſo uſe. Truly, when I conſider with my ſelf the pride of theſe fooles, which diſdain this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline part of Phyſick, which after their manner contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45531:240"/>
they call <hi>Chymericam,</hi> and therefore can neither help their own, nor many other diſeaſes. I call to minde a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, peradventure known unto them of <hi>Herachto Epheſio,</hi> which being ſick of a dropſie, deſpiſing the help of Phyſitians, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing himſelf over with cow-dung, ſet himſelf in the Sun to drie, and falling aſleep was torn in pieces of dogs: but theſe are more then ſufficiently anſwered unto theſe fools and ſlanderers.</p>
                           <p>Now I will declare what is my purpoſe and ſcope in the Treatiſe; verily to preſcribe plainly hereafter, not thoſe things which are already common, or (as it is commonly ſaid) known to blind men and Barbers, leſt I might ſeem to imitate thoſe that uſe to write <hi>Rhapſodias,</hi> and heaps, but the method and way of preparing Medicines by Spagerick art, that pertain unto Gunſhot, which I know are yet unknown unto many Phyſitians and Chirurgians. And this I can truly confeſſe, that I am induced for two cauſes to doe it: Firſt, to provoke thoſe that are better learned, if they have any better Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to utter them, as alſo that I might ſpecially help my countrie and mankinde: unto the which (the more is the grief) there is too much need of thoſe kinde of Medicines in theſe moſt lamentable and cruell times, wherein it hath ſo long been bloudded with domeſtical and civil wars; but to incounter with their ſlanders which cry out, that theſe kind of Medicines doe not onely require long and difficile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, but alſo that they are ſo dear that every one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily uſe them. I have thought good therefore firſt to ſet down common Medicines, and then to come to thoſe which I doe far more eſteem, as indeed they are far more excellent then the other, as by their preparation you may know. Albeit alſo I have determined to have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the poor and common Souldier, and to ſet down them apart that ſhall help the rich.</p>
                           <p>Therefore the Chirurgians are to be admoniſhed, that when they goe into the warres, that they take with them theſe things ready prepared, which are to be had at moſt Apothecaries.</p>

                              <p>Theſe potions for Wounds, although they drive not out the humours downwards, yet prevail they very much to cleanſe Wounds, becauſe they cleanſe ſuperfluous humours, and the blood from all filth, and by a certain marvellous quality where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they excel, they knit the broken bones, and help the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news that are hurt by Wounds, and helping nature, they at the laſt fill the Wound with fleſh, and cloſe them up without uſing any other remedy: when as I ſaw in <hi>Germany,</hi> the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous and almoſt incredible effect which came by the uſe of theſe potions, even in curing deſperate Ulcers, I thought it not meet to paſſe over the mention of them, and that ſo much the rather, becauſe I knew the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>But the Salt of Tartar you ſhall draw out of the Feces (which they call the dead head) which are left in the Retort. Thoſe you ſhall diſſolve in warm water, and after filter that which is diſſolved twice or thrice, coagulate it at the fire by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring away the water, and the ſalt will remain in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the veſſel, which if you again diſſolve and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late divers times, you ſhall purge it clear like Chriſtall.</p>
                           <p>This Chriſtaline ſalt if you put it into a glaſſe, and ſet it in a Wine cellar or other moiſt place, within few dayes it will reſolve into a clear oyle, very excellent to cleanſe the ſpots and ulcers of the face.</p>
                           <p>Take crude Tartar <abbr>lb</abbr> ii. Salt-Peter, Salt of Soot, of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Vinegar, <hi>ana</hi> four ounces, <hi>Calcis Vivae,</hi> ſix ounces, all broken very ſmall put into a veſſell not glaſed, but well ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Calcine it twelve hours, diſſolve that that is calcined in warm water, and diſtill it by filter, after coagulate it, and cleanſe it again, repeating three times your calcinations, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and coagulations; then put all into a Limbeck, and put on diſtilled vinegar that it be covered four fingers. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill the Vinegar in <hi>Balneo</hi> M. and there will come forth a ſweet liquor, then pour on the Vinegar again to diſtill, this do ſo long untill it be no more ſweet but ſour, as when you poured it on firſt, and ſo riſe in the Limbeck. Then diſtill all in a ſtrong fire by a Retort, and there will come forth a hot oyle, the commodities whereof can ſcarcely be declared.</p>
                           <p>After the ſame manner if you will, you may diſtill all the

                           <p>Vinegar being diſtilled by a Limbeck, the Feces remain in the bottome of the Veſſell, which firſt dried, afterward with a violent fire, if they be driven out by a Retort, there cometh forth a very red and ſharp oyle. Then if you doe again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the dead head or Feces in warm water, filter, and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate it, the ſalt of Vinegar will reſt, in the bottome, the which is very profitable for all eating Ulcers.</p>
                           <p>Soot brought into fine pouder, diſſolve it in diſtilled Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and ſeparating all the menſture, that which remaineth in the bottome diſſolve and coagulate again, ſo long till it come to white Salt, which in a moiſt place will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into oyle, very apt to cure the Gangraena and all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign ulcers.</p>
                           <p>Bole Armoniack made into fine pouder, diſſolve it in the ſour flegm of Allum, then ſeparate the flegm by <hi>Balneum</hi> and pour on other. Doe this three times, and then the Bole will be turned into a very fat oyle, which with a very ſoft fire is dryed, and brought into pouder moſt apt to ſtanch bloud, whereſoever it breake out.</p>
                           <p>Take of Cloves beaten in pouder one pound, ſimple water, or <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> which is better, ſix pound, infuſe them to digeſt in <hi>Balneo</hi> or dung four dayes, then put them in a Limbeck with his Refrigatorie, diſtill it according to art, and ſeparate the oyle from the water by a funnell, and keep it for your uſe.

for the dark words of Art, it ſhall not be incommodious to fix the Mercury with common Strong Water, three times poured on and drawn away, and to bring it into a red powder, and that with a ſufficient violent fire, that all the ſharpneſſe and venome of the menſtrew may be drawn away, which ſhall much the better be done, if this water following be mingled with it, and by often diſtillation ſeparated.</p>

                           <p>Make Amalgama with ℥. iiii. of Mercury crude, and ℥. i. of the beſt Tinne; ſpread this upon a plate of Iron, and ſet it in a moiſt place, and all will diſſolve into oyle, it is alſo made with Mercury alone, and a plate of Tinne.</p>
                           <p>Mercury, as the manner is, three times ſublimed with Salt of Vitriol, at the laſt is mingled with the like portion of ſalt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> and again ſublimed three or four times, all that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate is diſſolved into oyle, out of which the ſpirit of the ſalt <hi>Armoniack</hi> is to be drawn away; circulate all with the Eſſence of Wine, and diſtill it ſo long, untill the oyle have loſt his heat and ſharpneſſe, and the <hi>Armoniack</hi> be ſeparated.</p>
                           <p>It is alſo reduced by it ſelf into an oyle, with a very ſoft heat of an Athanor, by long diſtance of time.</p>

well prepared, untill it be utterly extinct; to this mixture pour Vinegar diſtilled, alcool ſated, that it may cover it four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; diſtil the liquor from the feces four or five times, until the Mercury be come into a very red powder, which you ſhall circulate with an alcool of Wine in a Pellican eight dayes, ſeparate the alcool by a Limbeck, and there will remain in the bottome, the moſt pretious and ſweet Balm of Mercury: It healeth all deſperate Ulcers, and alſo <hi>carbunculam in veſica,</hi> and greatly helpeth theſe Wounds by gun-ſhot. All other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Mercury, and the manner of uſing it, you ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the book which we lately ſet forth.</p>
                           <p>Upon the filings of Iron often waſhed with ſalt water, pour ſharp Vinegar, that it may cover it four fingers, ſet it upon warm aſhes eight dayes, every day moving the matter, and ſeparating the Vinegar which will be coloured, and pouring on again new, and that ſo long, till the Vinegar be no more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, which being vapoured away, take the powder that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the bottome, and ſublime it with a like portion of <hi>Armoniack;</hi> the ſame ſublimate you ſhall return again ſo often upon his feces, and ſublime again untill there appear the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a Rubie; then caſt all into ſcalding water, that the ſalt may diſſolve them, by and by put to cold water, and the Balm of <hi>Mars</hi> will reſt in the bottome like the calx of Gold; pour away the water, and put to freſh again, that the Balm may be made ſweet.</p>
                           <p>Of this with the ſpirit of Wine alcolizat by circulations, you ſhall make a red oyle, moſt excellent for all inward He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meroides, or Iſſues of blood, and to ſtrengthen the bowels, if one drop be mixed with conſerve of Roſes, or Confery, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Wine.</p>
                           <p>The filings of Iron firſt well waſhed, you ſhall calcine with the flower of Sulphur, or diſſolve with Strong Water, then pour on very ſharp Vinegar, and ſet it in a warm place cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dayes, then reverberate it with an open fire, as Art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, one whole day, gathering alwayes the flowers which remain above, untill all be converted into a very red and light powder.</p>
                           <p>After the ſame manner you ſhall make the Balme, Oyle,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45531:250"/>
and Crocus of Copper, out of the which, with the four flame of Vitriol, circulating all artificially, you ſhall draw a blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Vitriol, whoſe qualities we have deſcribed in another place.</p>
                           <p>Out of <hi>Saturne</hi> calcined is drawn a ſweetiſh ſalt in <hi>Balneo</hi> with diſtilled Vinegar, pouring it ſo often upon the Feces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it draw no more: The menſtrew evaporated, the ſalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the bottome, which by often diſſolutions, and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, is made Chriſtaline, and afterward eaſily diſſolved into oyle, being ſet in a moiſt place. But if you circulate this Chriſtaline ſalt in a Pellican, with the alcool of Wine fifteen dayes, and after take away the menſtrew by diſtillation, and put to new Wine and circulate it, putting to a fit doſe of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaline ſalt of Tartar, you ſhall make a Balm ſweeter then Sugar, which will marvellouſly prevail againſt all maligne Ulcers and diſeaſes of the eyes.</p>
                           <p>Decoct Antimony made in powder, with a capitall Lie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared of Tartar calcined, and Sope aſhes, and quick Lime, the ſpace of one hour, then let it cool, pouring upon it a little Vinegar, and there will appear a certain redneſſe ſwimming upon it, which you ſhall gather; then again let it boil for one hour or two, again let it cool, and gather that which ſwimmeth up; doe this ſo often, until there appear no more redneſſe; for it is the Sulphur of Antimony, which dried at a ſoft fire, you ſhall keep it to good uſes.</p>
                           <p>Mingle Antimony with Sugar and Allum, and put all into a Retort of glaſſe, make a ſoft fire for four or five houres, afterward increaſe it, and there will come out an Oyle red like bloud: It is alſo done with Mercury ſublimate, but great heed is to be taken, leſt any errour be committed in the degree of fire.</p>
                           <p>Boil Sulphur prepared with oyle of Linſeed, with a very ſoft fire, and it will be like bloud congealed: Let the matter cool, put it into a Retort, and give it fire, and there will diſtil out a very red oyle of Sulphur: It is alſo done, if you mingle Bran with your Sulphur and diſtil it.</p>
                           <p>Take of <hi>Sulphur Vivum</hi> P. i. with which mingle, with a ſoft fire, ſo much pure Vitriol molten, that it may be one body;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45531:250"/>
diſtil this by a Diſcentory, and there will deſcend a red oyle into the Receiver.</p>
                           <p>If <abbr>lb</abbr>. i. of the flower of Sulphur be mixed with ii. or iii. <abbr>lb</abbr>. of oyle of Turpentine in a dry heat, the flowers will diſſolve into a red oyle; then the menſtrew rightly and artificially ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, circulate the rubin of Sulphur with the Alcool of Wine eight dayes, and you ſhall have oyle of Sulphur that hath the qualities of the natural Balm.</p>
                           <p>The ſour oyle of Sulphur is made by Sulphur, by ſetting it on a fire, and hanging over it a bell, or a large glaſſe head, to keep the vapours which are converted into that ſour oyle.</p>
                           <p>Put Vitriol beaten into powder into a Cucurbite, giving it a fire of the ſecond degree, and there will iſſue a ſour water, which is called the flegm of Vitriol.</p>
                           <p>Take the Feces which remaineth in the bottome of the veſſel, which is called <hi>Colcothar,</hi> ſtamp that, and if you min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle flints withal, with a violent fire, there will come out a red oyle.</p>
                           <p>It is alſo made with the ſimple <hi>Colcothar,</hi> driven out with a violent fire three dayes ſpace, and there will come forth a very hot oyle, which is made ſweet by circulation, with ſpirit of Wine tartarizated.</p>
                           <p>But if the <hi>Colcothar</hi> be diſſolved in warm water, and the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it ſeparated, and the water evapourated, the <hi>Colcothar</hi> will remain ſweetiſh; that which remaineth, the redneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, is called <hi>Creta Vitrioli.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But if Vitriol be drawn by the ninth, a Limbeck pouring on alwayes the liquor upon the dead head, and after circulating all by the ſpace of eight dayes, you ſhall have the ſpirit of Vitriol, very profitable for many things.</p>
                           <p>The flegm of Allum is made like the flegm of Vitriol.</p>
                           <p>But Allum is prepared, if the flegm be five times poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Feces, out of which it was drawn and diſtilled, laſt of all dry out all the flegm until it be dry.</p>
                           <p>Make Brine of Salt, into which caſt hot burnings ſtones that they may be imbibed, thoſe ſtones ſo imbibed, put into a Retort, giving fire by degrees, there will comeforth a very hot oyle of Salt.</p>

                              <pb n="74" facs="tcp:45531:251"/>I ſaid before, that there was great force in <hi>Butyro Arſenici fixo</hi> to cure all venomous and Maligne Ulcers, it is made in this manner: Mingle chriſtaline <hi>Arſenick</hi> firſt ſublimed, with onely <hi>Colcothar</hi> (which doth keep back his poyſon) with like weight of Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Salt-Peter,</hi> put all into two glaſſes, and fix it, giving fire the ſpace of four and twenty houres, firſt very gentle, then of the higheſt degree: You ſhall find the matter very white fixed, reſembling the colour of Pearles, which diſſolve in warm water, that you may draw the <hi>Alcaly</hi> from it; and the powder which remaineth imbibe with oyle of <hi>Tartar,</hi> or of <hi>Talcum,</hi> which is better, and dry it at the fire, and doe this thrice: again diſſolve the matter in warm water, that you may take away his ſalt, and there will remain a very white powder and fixed, which will diſſolve in a moiſt place into a fat oyle, which is <hi>anodinum</hi> like Butter.</p>
                           <p>Out of Talcum rightly and artificially calcined is drawn the ſpirit with diſtilled Vinegar. This is diſſolved into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oyle, being ſet in a moiſt place.</p>
                           <p>Take of the juyce of <hi>Ariſtolochia Rotunda,</hi> and Savin, <hi>ana,</hi> iii. ounces, <hi>Serpentaria,</hi> two ounces, ſpirit of Wine one pound, circulate them firſt the ſpace of 24. houres, then diſtill them, of this water take <abbr>lb</abbr> i. of Elect <hi>Magnes</hi> made into pouder four ounces, circulate them together, and diſtill away the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Feces, reiterate this three times, and by this means you ſhall obtain the preparation of <hi>Magnes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But becauſe (as we have ſaid) the nobleſt parts are to bee ſtrengthened, and the heart, the principall organ of life, muſt alway be defended, theſe preparations following are to bee uſed.</p>
                           <p>Take of <hi>Theriaca</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> two ounces and a half, the beſt Myrrh, one ounce and half, Saffron <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ii. the ſpirit of wine ſix ounces, mingle all theſe, and in aſhes with a very ſoft fire diſtill it, circulate that which is diſtilled in <hi>Balneo</hi> eight dayes, and then diſtill it again.

                           <p>We have ſhewed the extraction of the tincture of Gold, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, naturall Balm, and the eſſence of Pearl in the Book which

                              <hi>Aurum vitae</hi> is made many waies, for being calcined after the Spagyrick manner, it is made light and ſpungeous, which cannot be reduced again, from which with diſtilled Vinegar is drawn a ſalt in <hi>Balneo,</hi> whoſe qualities by circulations with the ſpirit of Wine are ſo increaſed, that they ſeem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible for the curing of innumerable diſeaſes.</p>

                           <p>SO ſoon as the woman ſhall begin to be with child, which ſhe ſhall eaſily know, by ſtopping of her monethly flux,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45531:261"/>
without diſeaſe, or ancientneſſe of yeares; ſhe ſhall abſtain from all vehement motions and exerciſe, whether ſhe walk on foot, or ride on horſeback, or in a Coach, or be carried in a Horſe-litter; For where the body is too much ſtirred, the internall membrane of the Womb is either accuſtomed to be broken, or to be looſly reſolved, and thereupon abort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſently followeth.</p>
                           <p>To theſe things the woman with child muſt diligently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that ſhe lift not her armes up too high, nor carry great burthens, nor repoſe her ſelf on hard and uneaſie ſeats: But inſtead of exerciſe, which may alwayes in ſome precede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meat, ſhe may walk on foot gently, or ſuffer her body and armes gently to be rubbed and ſtroked, or may ſtretch them forth with ſpinning or carding.</p>
                           <p>Let her moderately uſe meat of good juyce and eaſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and Wine not too ſtrong and too ſharp, but a little mingled with water, or if ſhe be abſtemious, ſhe may uſe water wherein Cinnamon is boyled: But ſhe may not feed on ſweet meats, ſharp, and windy; ſhe muſt alſo avoid fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, thirſt, watching, mourning, ſadneſſe, anger, and all other perturbations of the mind.</p>
                           <p>Her familiar freinds muſt preſent no unwholſome thing to her, nor ſo much as name it, leaſt ſhe ſhould deſire it, and not be able to get it, and ſo miniſter her an occaſion of abort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Child carry with it ſome foule impreſſions. But if ſhe deſire chalk, clay, or coales, let beanes boyled with ſugar be given unto her: or if ſhe cannot get her long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let her preſently drink a large draught of pure cold water.</p>

                           <p>But if too much bloud abound, or ſome incident diſeaſe

                           <p>FRom that time forward none of the before mentioned remedies is wont, or ought from thence to be uſed, becauſe the Babe being now become greater, ſtandeth in need of greater nouriſhment and bloud, and alſo can bear no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of phyſick.</p>
                           <p>Although ſometimes I have met with women, which have ſo much abounded with bloud, that unleſſe they had been let bloud in the ſecond moneth, they would have aborted in the third; others again, unleſſe they ſhould attempt the ſame in the ſeventh or eight moneth, they could not carry their great belly ſo long, or elſe would be delivered of a dead iſſue.</p>
                           <p>But ſince theſe things happen but to few, they may not be granted to all, but we muſt provide for every one according to their nature and conſtitution.</p>
                           <p>And this is to be prohibited to all which are with child, that they give not way to take any bloud from the ancle bone of the foot, during the whole time of the womans going, but in ſtead thereof, if the diſeaſe ſo require, an ounce of <hi>Manna</hi> in the broth of a Cock, or ſo much <hi>Caſſia fiſtula,</hi>
                              <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45531:262"/>
or of Sirrups made of Damask-roſes infuſed in <hi>May</hi> dew, about the quantity of an ounce, with a little water of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, may ſafely be taken a little before meat.</p>
                           <p>But if the belly be bound onely without any apparent diſeaſe, the broth of a Chicken, or of Veal ſodden, with Oil, or with the decoction of Mallowes, or marſh-Mallowes, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and Linſeed, put up in a gliſter by the lower parts will not be amiſſe, yet in a leſſer meaſure then is wont to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in other Children, to wit, of the decoction five ounces, of common Oil three ounces, of Sugar two ounces, of <hi>Caſſia fiſtula</hi> one ounce. But ſharper Purgations, as alſo Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories made of Honey and Salt, are altogether hurtfull to great bellyed women, or ſuch as lie in childbed. But of fat Pork, which they call Lard, or the yolks of Eggs without ſalt, Purgations and Glyſters are commended.

                           <p>Moreover, ſhe may not bring her to labour and ſtrugling, before the birth ſhew it ſelf to her view; for they doe but labour in vain, and doe violently diſtort and wreſt away the ſtrength of the labouring woman, that afterward,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45531:265"/>
when ſhe ſhall have need, it will not be able to work it forth.</p>
                           <p>But ſhe ſhall ſit fitly over againſt the woman in labour, and ſhall diligently obſerve on what part the birth moveth it ſelf; for if it come the right way, ſhe ſhall annoint and cheriſh the ſecret parts with odoriferous Oils; and if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to the ſides, ſhe ſhall with both hands govern and diſpoſe the belly, that it may fall to the mouth of the womb.</p>
                           <p>And if the hand or feet ſhew it ſelf firſt, the Midwife, with a ſoft and gentle hand, moiſtened with broth of Fenugreek and Linſeed, ſhall gently reduce it into the place.</p>
                           <p>Certain women have the mouth of their womb ſo ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that without great help, ſcarce or never they can part with the child. And that cometh to paſs by reaſon of divers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for either ſome ſtrong heat coming from the natural parts, doth two much ſtreighten the inward parts, or the Creature is to big, or the child-bearing woman is to groſſe and fat, or the child is dead, who cannot by motion be furthering and helping to nature, or elſe cold for the moſt part in the winter, eſpecially in young ones, who have a narrow paſſage of the womb, doth more aſtringe and bind it up; or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heat in ſome is ſo diſſolved, that their ſtrength faileth them in the birth.</p>
                           <p>Therefore when there appeareth difficulty in bringing forth the Child, Jeſus Chriſt, the onely preſerver and ſaver in danger, is heartily to be called upon, that with his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious favour he would be pleaſed to be Aſſiſtant to the wretched party in travell.</p>

                           <p>LEt there be given unto the Infant new born Honey to lick, after let it be nouriſhed with the Mothers Milk, which of all things beſt agreeth with it. But if by reaſon of ſome neceſſity it cannot enjoy it, a ſound healthy Nurſe is to be choſen, neither younger than four and twenty yeares, nor elder than five and thirty, of a white and ruddy complexion, which is not infected with other vices, nor yet hath too lately been brought to bed, nor hath not long given ſuck; let her not have ſore Dugs or Breaſts, nor to big, but a large Breaſt, and moderately fat. Let her uſe choiſe meats of eaſie and light concoction, engendring good bloud or juyce; let her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from hot aromaticall Spices, as Pepper, Ginger, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damome, and ſuch like; alſo from Leeks, Onions, Garlick, Salt, auſtere and tart things: Let her avoid ſtrong Wines, as alſo cold water: Let her eſchew immoderate eating and drinking, for that corrupteth the Milk, and begetteth in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lepry, or ſcurfe, and other contagious diſeaſes: Let her
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45531:269"/>
abſtain from cares and vexations, and let her take heed, leaſt ſhe provoke her menſtruous diſeaſe.</p>
                           <p>She muſt not ſleep much, or be given to ſleep, for that maketh the Milk flegmatick; ſhe likewiſe ought not to watch more than is meet, for from hence the Milk cometh to be more hot, ſharp, and diſtaſtfull to the Infant; ſhe ought moderately to excrciſe her ſelfe, eſpecially her armes, to wit, either in ſowing, ſpinning, or knitting, for by this meanes evill humours are conſumed, as by eaſe and ſloth they are augmented.</p>
                           <p>Alſo copulation of the Nurſe exceedingly offendeth, and hurteth the Child, as that which cheifly retracteth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth the Milk, and maketh it of an unſavory taſte, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting hot, and rank, or goatiſh, which bringeth no ſmall inconvenience, and hurt to the Child. For which cauſe, in times paſt, Husbands were driven away from their Wives, and reſtrained from their companies.</p>
                           <p>But if the Milk decreaſe, Pulteſſes of Bean meal, and Riſe, are meet to be uſed; alſo like paps made of Bread, with Milk, and Sugar, to which may be added a little Fennel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed.</p>
                           <p>And if the Milk be thick, it muſt be made thinne, with ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diet, and ſubtill Wine, and Sirrup of Vinegar, as alſo with exerciſes: But if it be too thinne, and wateriſh, groſſe, and ſtrong meats, and longer ſleeps will be convenient and meet. For the corruption of the Milk, a litile Mug vort groſly bruiſed, and put into a linnen cloth, and ſo into broth, with a little Honey added thereto, will doe very much good.</p>

                              <p>And if the Childes belly be looſe, the food ought to be more groſſe and ſtrong, and her ſleeps longer: But children may ſuck ſo long, as till they have brought forth ſharp and great teeth: But if you ſuffer them to drink Wine, or ſtrong drink, or other Potions, before they have toothed them, they will be corrupted; but when they have gotten theſe teeth,

                           <p>THey are, faſting, to be bathed in water before meat, for the ſpace of a quarter of an hour, yet ſo, that the belly may firſt goe down or be emptied, and then they are to be annointed with oyle of Olives made hot.</p>
                           <p>And it is not of little concernment, in what ſwadling clothes children are wrapped; for when they are not tied up at all, or the clouts are too looſe, they are ſubject to Fluxes, Impoſthumes, apt to be crooked backt, and other diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; but eſpecially when their knees are too ſtrictly tied and bound up, and their thighs left at liberty, they are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                           <p>When they cry, or feel pain, or will ſleep, they are to be pacified, either by ſhewing the breaſt, or by ſinging, or by rocking, either in Cradles, or hanging Beds, or by carrying up and down. But we muſt obſerve, that children may lie ſtrait whenſoever they lie down, and ought not to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered too much, or hot with coverings, nor yet with too few, leaſt they may catch cold. Moreover, let the linnen cloth, wherein they are wrapped, be neat and clean, for children are offended, and infected by foul and filthy excrements.</p>
                           <p>From three years of age till the ſeventh, they are to be educated gently and kindly, not to be ſeverely reprehended, chidden, or beaten, for by that meanes they be made through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole life after too timorous, or too much terrified, aſtoniſhed, and ſotted.</p>
                           <p>Being yet in their firſt years, they are not to be compelled to going, for ſeeing all their bones are ſoft as Wax, and the body fall the heavier, they either become lame, or univerſally reſolved in their feet.</p>
                           <p>Food muſt be daily given them thrice a day, till they are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45531:270"/>
three years old; for if they be much filled, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and accuſtomed to be troubled with Convulſions, and other diſeaſes.</p>
                           <p>In the ſixth or ſeventh year of their age, they are to be ſent to ſchoole, and committed to the breeding and inſtruction of courteous and temperate Schoolmaſters, who may not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them.</p>
                           <p>Before theſe yeares they are not to be compelled or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to harder labours; otherwiſe they will not thrive well, but ſtand at a ſtay, and keep little, or become Dwarfes.</p>

                           <p>VVHen as the Infant beginneth to grow ſick, as for example, from a cold diſeaſe, the Nurſe is to be nouriſhed with hot and dry meat and drink, ſo that thereby forthwith it may grow well again; ſo alſo if it be taken with other diſeaſes, as with an Ague, the Nurſe ſhall uſe plantain water, and ſuch like things, Paps made for children of crums or morſels of bread broken or ſliced, are more wholeſome, than made of meal or flour.</p>
                           <p>Till two years old give them Honey often, for that keepeth them from Convulſions, and coſtiveneſſe of the belly, and that the milk they eat hurt them not.</p>
                           <p>When Infants caſt up their milk, a Corrall ſhould be hung about their neck down to their middle; for it is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them in teething, and Ivory alſo is good for the ſame purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>THere are divers cauſes whereof this diſeaſe may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as ſundry Writers doe alledge, as by over great and unnaturall heat and drought, by great rain and inundations of waters, or by great ſtore of rotten and ſtinking bodies,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45531:300"/>
both of men and beaſts, lying upon the face of the earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried, as in the time of warres hath been ſeen, which doth ſo corrupt the air, as that thereby our Corn, Fruits, Hearbs, and Waters, which we daily uſe for our food and ſuſtenance, are infected: alſo it may come by ſome ſtinking dunghils, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſtanding pooles of water, and unſavory ſmels, which are near the places where we dwell, or by thruſting a great company of people into a cloſe, narrow, or ſtreight room, as moſt commonly we ſee in Ships, common Gaoles, and in narrow and cloſe lanes and ſtreets, where many people doe dwell together, and the places not orderly kept clean and ſweet. But moſt commonly, in this our time, it is diſperſed amongſt us, by accompanying our ſelves with ſuch as either have, or lately have had the diſeaſe themſelves, or at leaſt have been converſant with ſuch as have been infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: But for the moſt part it doth come by receiving into our cuſtody ſome clothes, or ſuch like things, that have been uſed about ſome infected body, wherein the infection may lie hidden a long time, as hath been too too often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, with repentance too late in many places, It may alſo come by Dogs, Cats, Pigs, and Weaſels, which are prone and apt to receive and carry the infection from place to place. But howſoever it doth come, let us aſſure our ſelves, that it is a juſt puniſhment of God, laid upon us for our manifold ſins and tranſgreſſions againſt his divine Majeſty: for as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quicquid patimur ab alto venit,</hi> What croſſes or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſoever we ſuffer, it cometh from the Lord, either for a triall of our faith, or a puniſhment for our ſins. Wherefore to diſtinguiſh any farther thereof I think it needleſſe, for my intent is in breif ſort, ſo exactly as I can, to ſhew the meanes how to prevent the ſame, as alſo how to cure it when we are infected. But before I enter to treat thereof, I think it not amiſſe, to ſhew what forewarnings and tokens are given us before hand of the coming thereof, thereby the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſame by prayer and repentance.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Vicen,</hi> a noble Phyſitian ſaith, that when wee ſee the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall courſe of the ayre, and ſeaſons of the year to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as when the ſpring time is cold, clowdy, and dry, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time ſtormy, and tempeſtuous, the mornings and evenings to be very cold, and at noon extream hot, theſe do foreſhew the Plague to come. Alſo when we ſee fiery impreſſions in the firmament, eſpecially in the end of ſummer, as comets and ſuch like, and that in the begining of harveſt we ſee great ſtore of little frogs, red toades, and myſe on the earth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding extraordinarily: or when in ſummer we ſee great ſtore of toades creeping on the earth having long tailes, of an aſhy color on their backs, and their bellies ſpotted and of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and when we ſee great ſtore of gnats ſwiming on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or flying in great companies together, or when our trees and hearbs do abound with Caterpillars, Spiders, Moaths <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which devoure the leaves on the trees and hearbs on the earth, it ſheweth the ayre to be corrupt, and the Plague ſhortly after to follow. Alſo by the beaſts of the field we may perceive it (eſpecially ſheep) which will go mourning with their heads hanging down towards the ground, and divers of them dying without any manifeſt cauſe known unto us. Alſo when we ſee young Children flock themſelves together in companies, and then will faine ſome one of their company to be dead amongs them, and ſo will ſolemnize the buriall in a mournfull ſort, this is a token which hath been well obſerved in our age to foreſhew great mortality at hand. Alſo when we ſee rivers of water to overflow without any manifeſt cauſe, or ſuddenly vaniſh away and become dry: And when clear well-ſprings do ſuddenly become foule and troubled. Alſo when the ſmall-Pox doth generally abound both in young and old people, all theſe do foreſhew the Plague to come.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> Sheweth how to prevent the Plague.</head>
                     <p>THere are three principall meanes how to prevent this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe: The firſt and chiefeſt is to acknowledge our manifold ſins and wickedneſs unto almighty God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, with a hearty repentance and amendment of our former ſins committed againſt his divine majeſtie.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond means is to fly far off from the place infected, and as <hi>Rondoletius</hi> ſaith, not over haſtily to return thither again for fear of an after-clap: which ſaying is confirmed by <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Non enim morietur in bello, qui non eſt in illo:</hi> and the farther from it, the ſafer ſhall we be, yet were it a very uncharitable courſe that all which are of abillity ſhould do ſo, for then how ſhould the poor be relieved, and good orders obſerved: but for Children it were beſt to ſend them far off from the place, becauſe their bodies are moſt apt to receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as alſo for that they cannot ſo continually uſe antidots and preſervatives, which by their great heat may indanger them almoſt ſo much as the diſeaſe it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The third meanes conſiſteth chiefly in three points, which are theſe: Order, Diet, and Phyſicall helps. For the firſt you ſhall have a care that your houſes be kept clean and ſweet, not ſuffering any foule and filthy clothes or ſtinking things to remain in or about the ſame: and in ſummer ſeaſon to deck your windowes, and ſtrow your floors with ſweet and wholſom hearbs, floures, and leaves, of Mints, Balme, Penniroyall, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, Time, Majoram, red-Roſes, Carnations, Gelliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſuch like for your windowes, your floors to be ſtrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with green Ruſhes, and Mints, Oaken and Willow leaves, Vine leaves and ſuch like: your windowes which ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North and Eaſt, do you alwaies keep open in the day time, if the ayre be clear, and that no infected and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory ſmell be near the ſame, as Fogs, dunghils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every morning before you open either your doors, or windowes, as alſo in the evening when you go to bed, cauſe a good fire to be made in your Chamber, and burn ſome odoriferous or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45531:301"/>
ſweet perfumes in the middeſt thereof, as hereafter I will ſhew you, or in ſtead thereof ſome Juniper, Frankincenſe, Bay leaves, Roſemary, Lavender, Majoram, or ſuch like, which you muſt alwaies have dried in a readineſſe, and ſo in the fume or ſmoke thereof to breath and perfume the clothes which you are to weare.</p>

                     <p>FOr our diet as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth us, we muſt have a care not to exceed in eating and drinking but to keep a mean therein, and in any caſe to beware of ſurfeting and drunkenneſs, which are enemies both to the body and ſoule, but as we may not exceed in eating and drinking, ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure great hunger and thirſt is moſt dangerous, our meat ought to be of a facile and eaſie digeſtion, partly tending to a drying qualitie; as Cocks, Capons, Hens, Pullets, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, Pheaſants, Quailes, Pigeons, Rabbets, Kid, Veal, Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Birds of the Mountains, and ſuch like; but Beef, Pork, Veniſon, Hare and Goats fleſh is to be refuſed, and ſo are all water fowls, as Duck, Swan, Gooſe, Widgen, Teal, and ſuch like, becauſe they are hard to digeſt, and do increaſe ill blood, and naughtie juyce in the bodie: Lambs fleſh, becauſe of his exceeding moiſture is alſo to be refuſed, Eggs in the Summer not good, but in Winter tolerable: All Fiſhes which are of a hard fleſh, whether they be of the Sea, or freſh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are to be allowed. In freſh Rivers the Perch, Barble, Gudgeon, Loch, Cool, Trout, and Pike are good; and for Sea fiſh, the Gilthed, Turbet, Sole, Rochet, Gurnard, Lobſter, Crab, Praunes, Shrimps, Whiting, and ſuch like eaten with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45531:307"/>
There are ſome Authors which hold opinion, that Fiſh is better to be eaten then fleſh in the great fervent heat of the year, becauſe they doe make a more cold bloud in the body then fleſh; another reaſon is, becauſe they doe live under the water, they are not infected with any contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the aire, as Beaſts and birds may be, and therefore more wholſome, but in my judgement fleſh is more wholſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth-breed a more pure, and fine Juyce in the body then any Fiſh whatſoever; your bread ought to be made of pure wheat, not too new, nor too old, but of one dayes ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or two at moſt is beſt: Rie bread is to be eſchewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his great moiſture: your drink is beſt beer or ale, not too ſtrong or new, but the ſtaler and clearer it is the better, at your meals a draught or two of Claret wine is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, but in hot weather it were good to allay it with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle water, for wine doth warm the ſtomack, help digeſtion, and comfort the heart.</p>

                     <p>Walk not into the open ayre in the morning before the Sun hath had ſome power to cleanſe and clear the ſame, and in any caſe goe not abroad when great fogs and miſts are upon the earth, for it is dangerous: but if urgent occaſions move you, then before you goe forth of your doors be ſure to eat ſome preſervative firſt, and then take ſome good and odoriferous Pomander, Nodule, or Noſegay in your hand, as before is ſhewed you. The extream heat of the day is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be refuſed to walk in, becauſe it chafeth the bloud; as alſo in the evening after the Sun is ſet, for then unſavory and unwholſome Fogs ariſe out of the earth, and in any caſe if you can avoid it come not neer any any place infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but uſe to walk in the open aire and dry ground.</p>
                     <p>Uſe <hi>Venus</hi> combates moderately, but none at all were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the beſt time to uſe them is three or four hours after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, before you ſleep, and then reſt upon them.</p>
                     <p>Beware of anger, fear, and penſiveneſs of the minde, for by their means the body is made more apt to receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

                     <p>Bewar of ſleeping at noon, but ſpecially in the Winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but in Summer to take after dinner a nap of half an hour or an hour is tollerable in elderly bodies.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, Suffer not any Doggs, Catts, or Pigs to run about the ſtreets, for they are very dangerous, and apt to carry the infection from place to place.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Command that the excrements and filthy things which are voided from the infected places be not caſt into the ſtreets or rivers which are daily in uſe to make drink, or dreſſe meat.</p>

when it is removed, there is ſuch a ſtinking and unwholſome ſmell, as is able to infect the whole ſtreet where it is.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, To command that no Hemp or Flax be kept in wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter near the City or Town, for that will cauſe a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and infectious ſavour.</p>

                     <p>Now when you have been with any one ſo infected, before you go into the company of any whole and ſound people, it were neceſſary you do ſtand by a good fire, having all the clothes about you which you did wear when you were with the ſick, and then turn and aire your ſelfe well thereby, ſo ſhall you be ſure the leſſe to endanger others by your company.

                     <p>VVHen we perceive any to be infected with this contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſeaſe, we muſt with all poſſible ſpeed ſeek all the meanes we can how to prevent the malignity thereof, whoſe property is at the firſt to aſſault the principall part, which is the heart, and therefore requires preſent help; for unleſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done within eight or four and twenty houres, little will it then prevail to attempt it, for by that time nature is either ſubdued, and clean overthrown, or elſe hath thruſt the ſame to the exterior parts, or otherwiſe digeſted it: yet may we not neglect at any time, to uſe all the meanes we can, in helping and furthering of nature to the uttermoſt of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, becauſe we doe oftentimes ſee nature ſo wearied, and weakened in expelling of this venemous matter, that unleſſe ſome help be added to aſſiſt and comfort her, the party, for lack thereof, dyeth, which otherwiſe might be ſaved: For I have oftentimes ſeen by diligent helping of nature, that to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought to good paſſe, which I have judged moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. There are foure intentions required for the curing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; that is, by bloud-letting, Cordials, ſweat and purging: but the manner how to execute the ſame, hath bred great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both amongſt the old and later Writers, which here to treat of were too tedious, for unto the learned it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and for the commonalty little would it availe them, therefore in breif will I ſhew you what I have obſerved touching the cure.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if it be in a Plethorick, ſanguine, and ſtrong body, and hath pain in the head, great heat at the heart, thirſtneſſe, the pulſe ſtrong, and labouring, or beating ſtrongly, and hath great and large veines appearing; theſe ought preſently to be let bloud in that ſide where yee perceive the greif doth prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45531:311"/>
it ſelfe to come forth, and not viſibly appearing, tending to maturation: For then we may not draw bloud, but uſe all other meanes we can deviſe, in helping nature to expell it, neither may you draw bloud, if the party have a flix or lask (which is an evill ſign) in the beginning of the diſeaſe, for by that meanes you ſhall hinder nature greatly, but onely give the party Cordials; neither may you ſtop the flix in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but if it be extream, and that it ſtay not the ſecond day, then muſt you give ſome purgation, which may leave an aſtringency behind it, as hereafter in the cure of the flix ſhall be ſhewed. For as <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> in his firſt book and one and twentieth Aphoriſme, doth admoniſh us, we muſt conſider and mark, how nature doth incline her ſelf, for that will teach us what we are to doe.</p>
                     <p>Now if you perceive the botch or carbunkle to appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the chin about the throat, then preſently draw bloud in both veines under the tongue, and immediately after that apply a cupping glaſſe; with ſcarification in one ſide of the neck next unto the fore, thereby to draw it from the throat, for fear leaſt ſuddenly it choke him up, and then apply Chickens rumps, or Hens rumps to the botch, the feathers being firſt pluckt away from the rump, and a grain of Salt put into the tewell, and ſo hold the bare place to the greif untill the Chicken die, which will be within half an hour, and then apply another, and ſo continue in changing them ſo long as they doe die, and laſtly apply a mollificative Cataplaſme or plaiſter to the ſame place, as in the fift Chapter following is ſhewed, which is made with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum baſillicon,</hi> and to the botch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the <hi>Epithemation</hi> and Cataplaſme in the ſeventh Chapter following. But if it be in the neck, he doth complain, then let him bloud in the <hi>Cephallica</hi> vein in the arm, of the ſame ſide where he complaineth.</p>
                     <p>If in the groin or flanke he doth complain, then let him bloud in the foot on the ſame ſide, and open the vein called <hi>Maleola,</hi> or <hi>Saphena,</hi> the quantity muſt be according as the age and ſtrength of the party requireth, but at moſt draw not above ſix or eight ounces: For <hi>Avicen</hi> willeth us, to preſerve bloud as the treaſure of nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:45531:311"/>But in a weak, ſpare, and cachochimious body (as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us) we may not draw bloud at all, for thereby ſhould you greatly indanger the Patient, but help ſuch by Cordials and ſweat.</p>
                     <p>And here you ſhall underſtand, that unleſſe Phlebotomy be done at the firſt, that is, within ſix or eight houres at moſt, it will be too late to attempt it, neither may you doe it if the ſore doe appear up in height tending to ſuppuration, for then ſhould you hinder nature, which like a diligent workman, hath diſcharged and thruſt forth that venomous matter, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would have killed us.</p>
                     <p>And here touching Phlebotomy or bloud-letting, you muſt have this ſpeciall care, that you draw not bloud on the oppoſite ſide, as if it be on the left ſide the ſore appear, then draw not bloud on the right ſide; if it appear in the flanke, then draw not bloud in the arme, but in the foot, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ſhall draw that venomous matter from the ignoble unto the noble parts, and ſo kill the body.</p>
                     <p>And although the party complain not more in the one ſide then the other, yet by the pulſe ſhall you perceive on which ſide the venome lieth hidden, for on that ſide where nature is oppreſt, there ſhall you find the pulſe more weak, feeble, and uneven, greatly differing from the other ſide.</p>
                     <p>And here you ſhall underſtand, that in ſome it hath been ſeen, that nature of it ſelf at the firſt, hath thruſt out that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous matter in ſome place of the body, with a botch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing high, and tending to ſuppuration, or a carbunckle, or ſpots called purples. Now here if you draw bloud, you doe then greatly indanger the body; but in this caſe you muſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give Cordials, and uſe all the meanes you can to bring it outward, either by maturation, or evaporation, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed you.</p>
                     <p>And here you ſhall further underſtand, that where the age, conſtitution, nor ſtrength of the party will permit that Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy be done, yet for the better help of nature you muſt apply Ventoſes, with reaſonable deep ſcarification, unto the next place adjoyning, where the party complaineth, thereby the more ſpeedily to draw the venomous matter unto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45531:312"/>
parts, and there to apply the rumps of Chickens, as before is taught you, and ſo apply to the place ſome ſtrong maturative, and atrractive plaiſter, or Cataplaſme, as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed you. If the greif be in the head or throte, then apply Ventoſes to the neck: If it be in the emunctuaries of the heart, then apply them to the ſhoulders: If in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctuaries of the liver, then apply them to the buttocks or thighs, now when this is done, either by Phlebetomy, or Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſes, then within an hour or two at the moſt after it, you muſt give the ſick ſome good Cordiall Medicine, which hath power to comfort the heart, reſiſt the venomous matter, and alſo procure ſweat, whereof out of the following you may make choice as you liſt.</p>

                        <head>The cauſe of the Pox and Meaſels.</head>
                        <p>The primitive cauſe as <hi>Valetius</hi> ſaith, is by alteration of the aire, in drawing ſome putrified and corrupt quality unto it, which doth cauſe an ebullition of our bloud.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe antecedent is repletion of meats, which do eaſily corrupt in the ſtomack, as when we eat milk and fiſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at one time, or by neglecting to draw bloud, in ſuch as have accuſtomed to doe it every year, whereby the bloud doth abound.</p>
                        <p>The conjunct cauſe is the menſtruall bloud, which from the beginning in our mothers wombs wee received, the which mixing it ſelf with the reſt of our bloud, doth cauſe an Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the whole.</p>
                        <p>The efficient cauſe is, nature or naturall heat, which by that menſtruall matter mixing it ſelf with the reſt of our blouds doth cauſe a continuall vexing and diſquieting thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an unnaturall heat is increaſed in all the body, cauſing an Ebullition of bloud, by the which this filthy menſtrual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45531:326"/>
is ſeperated from our natural bloud, and the nature being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and overwhelmed therewith, doth thruſt it to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pores of the skin as the excrements of bloud, which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if it be hot and ſlimie, then it produceth the Pox, but if dry and ſubtil, then the Meaſels or Males. But <hi>Mercurialis</hi> an excellent writer in Phyſick, in his firſt Book, <hi>de morbis puero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, cap.</hi> 2. agreeing with <hi>Fernelius</hi> in his Book <hi>De abdit is rerum cauſis, c.</hi> 12. doth hold opinion, that the immediate cauſe of this diſeaſe doth not proceed of menſtrual bloud, but of ſome ſecret and unknown corruption, or defiled quality of the aire, cauſing an Ebullition of bloud, which is alſo verified by <hi>Valetius,</hi> and now doth reckon it to be one of the hereditable diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe few or none doe eſcape it, but that either in their youth, ripe age, or old age, they are infected therewith. The contention hereabout is great, and mighty reaſons are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned on both ſides, therefore I will leave the judgement thereof unto the better learned to define; but mine opinion is, That now it proceedeth of the Excrements of all the four humours in our bodies, which ſtriving with the pureſt, doth cauſe a ſupernatural heat and ebullition of our bloud, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beginning with a Fever in the moſt part, and may well be reckoned in the number of thoſe diſeaſes which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Epidemia:</hi> as <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> in his firſt Book, <hi>De morbis contag. cap.</hi> 13. witneſſeth this diſeaſe is very contagious and infectious, as experience teacheth us: There are two ſpeciall cauſes why this diſeaſe is infectious: The firſt is, be cauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth by ebullition of bloud, whoſe vapour being entred into another bodie, doth ſoon defile and infect the ſame, the ſecond reaſon is, becauſe it is a diſeaſe hereditable; for we ſee when one is infected therewith, that ſo many as come neer him, (eſpecially thoſe which are allyed in the ſame bloud) doe aſſuredly for the moſt part, receive the infection alſo.</p>

                     <p>THere are two ſpeciall meanes required for curing this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, the firſt is to help nature to expell the ſame from the interior and principall parts unto the exterior: the ſecond is to preſerve both the interior and exterior parts, that they may not be hurt thereby.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt intention, if the age and ſtrength of the ſick will permit, and that the Pox or Meaſels appear not, it were then good in the firſt, ſecond, or third day to draw bloud out of the Baſilica veine in the right arme, if he be not under the age of fourteen years, but the quantity muſt be at the diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him that draweth it, either more or leſſe as occaſion is offered: but for children and ſuch as are of tender years, and weak bodies, it were not good to draw bloud out of the arme, but out of the inferior parts, as the thighes, hams buttocks, and the Emeroidall veines, eſpecially if the party be melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, or elſe to apply ventoſe; to the loynes, buttocks, or hams, which may boldly be uſed both before and after they do appear, either with ſcarification, or without, as cauſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, which is a ſpeciall good meanes to draw that Ichorous matter from the interior to the exterior parts; but for ſucking Children, it were beſt to apply bloud-ſuckers unto any of the foreſaid places, which is a thing that may be uſed with more eaſe then ventoſes, neither do I wiſh either of them to be uſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe neceſſity require it, which is, when the matter lieth lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the interior parts, not offering it ſelf to appear out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly: otherwiſe I hold it better to leave the whole work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature, ſpecially in ſucking children: for when we ſee that nature is ready, or doth endeavour to expell the malignity which is in the interior parts to the exterior, which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by reviving of the Spirits, and mitigating of the Fever: here we ought not to uſe any meanes at all, but leave the whole operation to nature, which we muſt onely help by keeping

                     <p>The air is infected, when the temperateneſſe of the air is changed from his naturall ſtate, to exceſſive heat and moiſture, which is the worſt temperament of the air, the vapours drawn up by the heat of the Sun being unconſumed, rot, putrifie, and corrupt, and ſo with the venome infect the air: Alſo dead Carkaſes lying unburied, as it often chanceth in Warres, evaporations of Pooles, Fens, Mariſhes, ſtinking and noyſome ſents and Kennels, and Aſtronomers ſay, Aſpects, Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Oppoſitions of ill Planets, and Eclipſes of the Sun and Moon.</p>
                     <p>Alſo diſordering ones ſelf, either in diet or exerciſes bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one into the Peſtilence; therefore in time of contagion, outrages and ſurfets are to be avoided, as alſo all exceſſe of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking, ſweating, bathing, lechery, and all other things that open the pores of the body, and enter thereby ill aires, which invenome the lively ſpirits.</p>

                        <p>The ſignes which declare one infected already are many; but the ſecret token of all to know the infected of the Plague is, if there ariſe botches behind the eares, or under the arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, or about the ſhare; or if Carbunkles ſuddenly ariſe in any member, for when they appear, they betoken ſtrength of nature, which being ſtrong, laboureth to drive the poyſon out of the body; but if botches doe not appear, it is more dangerous, for it ſheweth, that nature is weak and feeble, and not able to expell and thruſt forth the venomous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and then you muſt have reſpect to the ſignes before rehearſed.</p>

                        <p>In a man are three principall parts (that is) the Heart, Liver, and Brains, and each of theſe hath his cleanſing place:

If they appear in the neck, they ſhew the Brains to be cheifly vexed, if under the arme-holes the Heart, but if they appear in the ſhare, the Liver is moſt infected,</p>
                        <p>For when a man hath taken infection, it preſently mingleth with the bloud, and runs to the heart, which is the cheif part of man, and the heart putteth the venome to his cleanſing place, which is the arme-holes; and that being ſtopt, putteth it to the next principall part, which is the liver, and it paſſeth it to his cleanſing place, which is the ſhare, and they being ſtopt, paſſe it to the next principall place, that is, the braines, and to their cleanſing places, which are under the eares, or under the throat, and they being ſtopped, ſuffer it not to paſſe out, and then it is moved twelve hours before it reſt in any place, and if it be not let out within the ſpace of four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours by bleeding, it brings a man into a peſtilentiall Ague, and cauſeth a botch in one of thoſe three places, or near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them</p>

                        <p>If the botch appear in the ſhare, bleed in the ankle on the ſame ſide, in any caſe not in the arme, for it will draw up the matter again.</p>
